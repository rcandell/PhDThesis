IoT focus
 
\section{The Importance of Wireless in Automation}

The fourth industrial revolution, commonly referred to as Smart Manufacturing in the U.S. and Industry 4.0 in Europe, promises unparalleled productivity and capability advances in the manufacturing.  Propelled by economic pressure toward greater efficiency, factory agility, and product customization, future factories will have the technological ability to adapt to customer demands quickly, modify manufacturing processes automatically based on quality feedback, and fabricate products with a reduced environmental impact.  Technological advances required for smart manufacturing to be truly successful include a collaborative and mobile robotics, distributed machine autonomy based on artificial intelligence, and a high degree of interconnectivity of among the automation resources.  Robots will work together and with people to accomplish complex tasks.  Robots will have the ability to roam between work-cells within a factory, learn its role quickly, become aware of edge devices, and communicate with other actors within the work-cell to accomplish its goals.  Current manufacturing architectures use wired connectivity through field bus and industrialized Ethernet for sensing and real-time control.  

Indeed, through advances in time-sensitive networking, many of the promises of smart manufacturing are being realized; however, the true goals of smart manufacturing require a large deployment of sensing and actuation devices and untethered (i.e. mobile), autonomous robotics actors.  The use of wires precludes mobility and makes deployment of edge devices more expensive as each devices requires power, wires, and conduit for communication. By adopting wireless for both sensing and control of machines within the work-cell, a lower-cost, untethered operation is achievable. once wireless is adopted as the primary mode of communication, questions arise as to the required latency, reliability, and scale of the wireless network especially when the network is used for the control of machines and the assurance of safety. 

Latency is defined as the data time-of-flight between two applications, e.g. when an event is acquired at a sensor to the point it is made available at a programmable logic controller (PLC).  Reliability is defined as the data loss probability between two applications. Scale is defined as the number of stations accessing the wireless network.  The requirements of reliability, latency, and scale directly relate to the complexity and cost of the wireless network; therefore, a rigorous analysis, validated by physics and untainted by market hype, is necessary to define realistic, achievable, and cost effective performance parameters of the wireless network.  In this paper, we investigate the validity of commonly advertised requirements of wireless networks used for industrial control systems whiling providing a validated perspective on those requirements making realization of such networks more achievable using existing technologies.  We begin with a close examination of existing wireless network requirements for factory automation. We follow with an architectural analysis of the future collaborative work-cell. This architectural analysis drives a cyberphysical system simulation to determine limits of reliability, latency, and scale constraints of wireless stations within the work-cell.  We then conclude with recommendations for reliability, latency, and scale constraints that will accommodate most industrial automation applications and are realizable with devices that are based on ubiquitous standards.

\section{Need for Evaluation Methods }
Explain how testing the communication network is not sufficient.  need to test the impact of network on the physical system.  Need methods by which to do this.  Start with requirements, proceed to design of the system, and then verification of performance of network AND physical system, and then feedback into design/requirements.
