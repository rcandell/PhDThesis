A clearer concept of the requirements will not only allow for the development of realistic wireless systems, but it is also essential in the construction of more accurate models, the conduct of more effective testing, and better analysis the performance measurement data that results.

We are going to provide a visual map of how it all fits together: flow chart of activities, papers, and data outputs
