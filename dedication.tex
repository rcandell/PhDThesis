\chapter*{Dedication}
The author would like express his gratitude to his beautiful daughter, Erin, for all of her
generous support, kindness, and care, and her countless hours as a child accompanying me in my laboratory. I hope that she
remembers fondly those weekends listening to her Avengers movies while I ran factory simulators and troubleshooted robots.
