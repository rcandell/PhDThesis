\chapter*{Dedication}
The author would like dedicate my thesis to my beautiful daughter, Erin, for her
kind heart and her countless hours as a child accompanying me in my laboratory. I hope that she
remembers fondly those weekends listening to her Avengers movies and helping me out while I ran wireless simulations and troubleshooted robots.
