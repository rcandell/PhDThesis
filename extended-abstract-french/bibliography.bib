A new testbed was recently designed and developed to facilitate such studies in work-cells by replicating various data flows in an emulated production environment. In this paper, an approach to storing and analyzing network performance data from a manufacturing factory work-cell is introduced. A robotic testbed was constructed using two collaborative grade robot arms, machine emulators, and wireless communication devices. A graph database approach was implemented to capture network flight data and operational event data among the actors within the testbed. A proposed schema is developed and elaborated, the database is then populated with events from the tested, the resulting graph is presented. Query commands are then presented as a means to examine and analyze network performance and relationships within the actors of the network. Additionally, we demonstrate how to extract correlations between receive signal power and network delay within the testbed using the graph database query language. Finally, using the inherent interconnected nature of the graph database, we discuss applying the graph database approach toward examining more complex relationships between the wireless communications network and the operational system.},

Main challenges of wireless deployment include the stochastic nature of the wireless channels and the harsh industrial transmission environment. In this work, a typical two-dimensional gantry system is controlled by a local controller which receives G-code commands wirelessly over a Wi-Fi network. The industrial wireless channel is replicated using a radio frequency (RF) channel emulator where various scenarios are considered and various wireless channel parameters are studied. The movement of the gantry system tool is tracked using a vision tracking system to quantify the impact of the wireless channel on the system performance. Numerical results are presented including the total run time of an industrial process and the dwell times at various positions through the process.}",

	abstract = "{Wireless communication is a key enabling technology central to the advancement of the goals of the Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing concept. Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are constructing a testbed to aid in the adoption of wireless technology within the factory workcell and other harsh industrial radio environments. In this paper the authors present a new industrial wireless testbed design that motivates academic research and is relevant to the needs of industry. The testbed is deigned to serve as both a demonstration and research platform for the wireless workcell. The work leverages lessons learned from past incarnations that included a dual robot machine tending scenario and a force-torque seeking robot arm apparatus. This version of the testbed includes computational and communication elements such that the operation of the physical system is noticeably degraded under the influence of radio interference, competing network traffic, and radio propagation effects applied within the lab. Key performance indicators of the testbed are selected and presented which include communication, computational, and physical systems indicators. The testbed includes two collaborative grade robot arms, programmable logical controllers, and high-performance computing devices for situational tracking, alerting, and control. Important topics presented include use case selection, middleware candidate selection (ROS/ROS2), and the selection of protocols for the study of high-reliability, low-latency communication solutions. Data products and machine learning application opportunities are explored. The paper is aimed to provide our contribution to the exploration of industrial wireless testbed design while soliciting feedback from fellow researchers.}",
