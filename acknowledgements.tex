\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

My deepest gratitude goes to my Lord, God, for all of his support, guidance, and training, and wisdom.  Without the endowment of my abilities, this work would have been made impossible.  I have been blessed with intelligence and creativity sufficient to perceive a vision, communicate that vision, and then direct a team more capable than myself to implement that vision.  I would like to extend my deepest thanks to my research team.  Without their help during trying times, this thesis would have been possible. I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Professor Foufou, whose steadfast encouragement to persevere has not gone unnoticed.
