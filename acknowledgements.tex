\chapter*{Acknowledgments}

My deepest gratitude goes to my Father in heaven.  I have been blessed with intelligence and creativity sufficient to perceive a vision, communicate that vision, and then direct a team more capable than myself to implement that vision.  I would like to extend my deepest thanks to my research team. Without their help during trying times, this thesis would not have been possible. I would like to acknowledge my advisor, Professor Foufou, whose guidance and steadfast encouragement to persevere has not gone unnoticed. I would finally like to acknowledge all of the members of my doctoral review committee for their time and attention in reviewing my work and providing their kind recommendations to improve the finalization of my thesis.
