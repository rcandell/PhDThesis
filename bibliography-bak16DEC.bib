This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

@article{Rappaport1989,
	abstract = {Wide-band multipath measurements at 1300 MHz have been made in five factory buildings in Indiana. Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

	abstract = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

However, great challenges are also met due to the network-induced imperfections. Such network-induced imperfections are handled as various constraints, which should appropriately be considered in the analysis and design of NCSs. In this paper, the main methodologies suggested in the literature to cope with typical network-induced constraints, namely time delays, packet losses and disorder, time-varying transmission intervals, competition of multiple nodes accessing networks, and data quantization are surveyed; the constraints suggested in the literature on the first two types of constraints are updated in different categorizing ways; and those on the latter three types of constraints are extended.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

	Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.",

For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.",

	abstract = "Abstract Industrial accidents are a major concern for companies and families alike. It is a high priority to all stakeholders that steps be taken to prevent accidents from occurring. In this paper, three approaches to safety are examined: fault trees (FT), Bayesian networks (BN), and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). A case study of a propane feed control system is used to apply these methods. In order to make safety improvements to industrial workplaces high understanding of the systems is required. It is shown that consideration of the chance of failure of the system components, as in the \{FT\} and \{BN\} approaches, may not provide enough understanding to fully inform safety assessments. The \{FT\} and \{BN\} methods are top-down approaches that are formed from the perspective of management in workplaces. The \{FRAM\} methodology uses a bottom-up approach from the operational perspective to improve the understanding of the industrial workplace. The \{FRAM\} approach can provide added insight to the human factor and context and increase the rate at which we learn by considering successes as well as failures. \{FRAM\} can be a valuable tool for industrial safety assessment and to consider industrial safety holistically, by providing a framework to examine the operations in detail. However, operations should be considered using both top-down and bottom-up perspectives and all operational experience to make the most informed safety decisions. "

	abstract={Thousands of industrial gas leaks occur every year, with many leading to injuries, deaths, equipment damage, and a disastrous environmental effect. There have been many attempts at solving this problem, but with limited success. This paper proposes a wireless gas leak detection and localization solution. With a monitoring network of 20 wireless devices covering 200 m2, 60 propane releases are performed. The detection and localization algorithms proposed here are applied to the collected concentration data, and the methodology is evaluated. A detection rate of 91% is achieved, with seven false alarms recorded over 3 days, and an average detection delay of 108 s. The localization results show an accuracy of 5 m. Recommendations for future explosive gas sensor design are then presented.},

	abstract={New paradigms in industrial robotics no longer require physical separation between robotic manipulators and humans. Moreover, in order to optimize production, humans and robots are expected to collaborate to some extent. In this scenario, involving a shared environment between humans and robots, common motion generation algorithms might turn out to be inadequate for this purpose. This paper proposes a kinematic control strategy which enforces safety, while maintaining the maximum level of productivity of the robot. The resulting motion of the (possibly redundant) robot is obtained as an output of an optimization-based real-time algorithm in which safety is regarded as a hard constraint to be satisfied. The methodology is experimentally validated on a dual-arm concept robot with 7-DOF per arm performing a manipulation task.},

This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

Radio channels in radio systems are usually characterized as multipath fading channels. In environment between transmitter and receiver there exist two main signal propagation components, Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS), which are described through Rician fading model, resp. Rayleigh fading model. The parameter which is widely used for channel classification is the channel impulse response.},

Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

  abstract    = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

	Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay.

Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios.

	abstract="The successful introduction of flexible, reconfigurable and self-adaptive manufacturing processes relies upon evolving traditional automation ISA-95 automation solutions to adopt innovative automation pyramids. These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.",

This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.",

	abstract={Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

The protocol is applicable to systems communicating via packet networks. Heterogeneous systems are enabled that include clocks of various inherent precision, resolution, and stability to synchronize. System-wide synchronization accuracy and precision in the sub-microsecond range are supported with minimal network and local clock computing resources. Simple systems are installed and operated without requiring the management attention of users because the default behavior of the protocol allows for it.},

Such work-cell will operate autonomously with a high degree of mobility enabled by wireless technology. This model describes the work-cell using the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). Using SysML the structural and parametric characteristics of the work-cell are described. Our model provides the architectural components and performance constraints of the work-cell in which wireless is used for a significant portion of connectivity. It identifies the structural components, interfaces, and data flows. Parametric characteristics that impact work-cell performance are included in the model. Using this model, industrial wireless networking requirements and work-cell behaviors may be developed and performance limits may be evaluated. MagicDraw 18.4 or higher is required to use this data.

@book{Friedenthal2015.SysML,
	abstract = {Systems engineers must understand how all the parts of a digital system work together, including hardware AND software. SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

  abstract    = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

	Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.},

For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.},

These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a decomposition method for evaluating the performance of continuous flow lines with machines characterized by general Markovian fluid models and finite capacity buffers is proposed. This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.},

  abstract  = {Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

	abstract="Accurate estimation of ventricular volumes plays an essential role in clinical diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Existing methods either rely on segmentation or are restricted to direct estimation of the left ventricle. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct and joint volume estimation of bi-ventricles, i.e., the left and right ventricles, without segmentation and user inputs. Based on the cardiac image representation by multiple and complementary features, we adopt regression forests to jointly estimate the two volumes. Our method is validated on a dataset of 56 subjects with a total of 3360 MR images which shows that our method can achieve a high correlation coefficient of around 0.9 with manual segmentation obtained by human experts. With our proposed method, the most daily-used estimation of cardiac function, e.g., ejection fraction, can be conducted in a much more efficient, accurate and convenient way.",

@book{Cossio2012,
	abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

@book{Cossio2012.RoboticsHandbook,
	abstract = {The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences {\&} Mathematics as well as the organization's Award for Engineering {\&} Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook's team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.},

@article{LeeRodgers1988,
	abstract = {In 1885, Sir Francis Galton first defined the term "regression" and completed the theory of bivariate correlation. A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

	abstract = {—The ever-growing proliferation of wireless devices and technologies used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as patient monitoring, military surveillance, and industrial automation and control, has created an increasing need for methods and tools for connectivity prediction, information flow monitoring, and failure analysis to increase the dependability of the wireless network. Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we share our experience in troubleshooting coexistence problems in operational IIoT networks by reporting on examples that show the possible hurdles in carrying out failure analysis. Our experience motivates the need for a user-friendly, automated failure analysis system, and we outline an architecture of such system that allows to observe multiple com-munication standards and unknown sources of interference.},

	abstract="With the recent growth of the graph-based data, the large graph processing becomes more and more important. In order to explore and to extract knowledge from such data, graph mining methods, like community detection, is a necessity. Although the graph mining is a relatively recent development in the Data Mining domain, it has been studied extensively in different areas (biology, social networks, telecommunications and Internet). The legacy graph processing tools mainly rely on single machine computational capacity, which cannot process large graph with billions of nodes. Therefore, the main challenge of new tools and frameworks lies on the development of new paradigms that are scalable, efficient and flexible. In this paper, we will review the new paradigms of large graph processing and their applications to graph mining domain using the distributed and shared nothing approach used for large data by Internet players. The paper will be organized as a walk through different industrial needs in terms of graph mining passing by the existing solutions. Finally, we will expose a set of open research questions linked with several new business requirements as the graph data warehouse.",

This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

The control scheme was scaled up to a multimode multiplant arrangement with coordination among loops. To examine the wireless control loop performance, we use the rotating base variation of the linear inverted pendulum.

We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

  abstract    = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

  abstract        = {Networked control systems (NCSs) have, in recent years, brought many innovative impacts to control systems. However, great challenges are also met due to the network-induced imperfections. Such network-induced imperfections are handled as various constraints, which should appropriately be considered in the analysis and design of NCSs. In this paper, the main methodologies suggested in the literature to cope with typical network-induced constraints, namely time delays, packet losses and disorder, time-varying transmission intervals, competition of multiple nodes accessing networks, and data quantization are surveyed; the constraints suggested in the literature on the first two types of constraints are updated in different categorizing ways; and those on the latter three types of constraints are extended.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

	Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.},

For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.},

These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a decomposition method for evaluating the performance of continuous flow lines with machines characterized by general Markovian fluid models and finite capacity buffers is proposed. This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.},

  abstract  = {Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Random forests are a combination of tree predictors such that each tree depends on the values of a random vector sampled independently and with the same distribution for all trees in the forest. The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

Existing methods either rely on segmentation or are restricted to direct estimation of the left ventricle. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct and joint volume estimation of bi-ventricles, i.e., the left and right ventricles, without segmentation and user inputs. Based on the cardiac image representation by multiple and complementary features, we adopt regression forests to jointly estimate the two volumes. Our method is validated on a dataset of 56 subjects with a total of 3360 MR images which shows that our method can achieve a high correlation coefficient of around 0.9 with manual segmentation obtained by human experts. With our proposed method, the most daily-used estimation of cardiac function, e.g., ejection fraction, can be conducted in a much more efficient, accurate and convenient way.},

This paper proposes a new robust {\$}{\$}R^2{\$}{\$}R2measure that is found to work better than existing measures across scenarios. Performance superiority has been demonstrated using extensive simulation results and three real publicly available datasets.

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

  abstract      = {The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences {\&} Mathematics as well as the organization's Award for Engineering {\&} Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook's team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.},

A decade later, Karl Pearson developed the index that we still use to measure correlation, Pearson's r. Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

  abstract  = {—The ever-growing proliferation of wireless devices and technologies used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as patient monitoring, military surveillance, and industrial automation and control, has created an increasing need for methods and tools for connectivity prediction, information flow monitoring, and failure analysis to increase the dependability of the wireless network. Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we share our experience in troubleshooting coexistence problems in operational IIoT networks by reporting on examples that show the possible hurdles in carrying out failure analysis. Our experience motivates the need for a user-friendly, automated failure analysis system, and we outline an architecture of such system that allows to observe multiple com-munication standards and unknown sources of interference.},

	abstract="Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is one of the vertical sectors that will benefit from 5G communication systems, but today, these systems are still dominated by technologies such as ZigBee and WiFi. An M2M scenario will experience dense deployment of ZigBee and WiFi nodes in order to route the data from one end to the other. In the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, both of the technologies perform co-channel overlapped operation and hence face severe cross technology co-channel interference (CCI). In contrast to cellular systems, which solve the CCI by centralized coordination through the base station, addressing CCI in the ISM band is non-trivial due to heterogeneous wireless technologies and the lack of centralized coordination. In this work, we first present interference mitigating receiver architectures for OFDM-based WiFi using single and multiple antennas. Our single antenna work is based on the localized estimation of excess noise caused by single and multiple co-channel narrowband interferers and scaling the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) of the affected WiFi subcarriers. The simulation shows our method achieves a significant gain in SNR compared to the conventional method for a given packet error rate (PER) criterion. Next, we discuss maximal ratio combiner with LLR scaling (MLSC), which is a multi-antenna extension to our previous work. The simulation shows MLSC achieves diversity gain apart from the gain in SNR. Further, we propose soft-bit maximal ratio combiner with LLR scaling (SB-MLSC). SB-MLSC is an easy to implement version of MLSC. However, diversity combining in SB-MLSC is performed by combining the LLRs. Nonetheless, simulations show equivalence in performance by SB-MLSC and MLSC. Finally, as a significant part of this work, we implemented all our methods using a software-defined radio (SDR) and performed over-the-air (OTA) testing in the 2.4-GHz ISM band using standard WiFi and ZigBee frames. Results of OTA tests fall in complete agreement with our simulations indicating the practical applicability of our methods. Our methods apply to all the standards and related radio transmission techniques which are based on OFDM and face narrowband co-channel interference. Additionally, since our work focuses only on receiver side modifications, they can be integrated with the existing infrastructure with minimal modifications.",

A kind of unsupervised machine learning algorithm is proposed, which can independently identify and select the optimal eigenvalue without relying on the prior information. First, the wave signal filtering is reduced and processed by kernelized principle component analysis (KPCA) algorithm. Then, the eigenvalues are selected and the redundant features are eliminated by adaptive parameter adjustment denoising auto-encoder (APADAE) algorithm. Finally, the feature vectors are classified and identified by Softmax algorithm and the classification process are optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Experimental results of the Smart Cyber-Physical systems show that the algorithm can indirectly improve the accuracy of the source location based on improving the classification accuracy.",

By DoS attacks we mean interruptions of communication on measurement (sensor-to-controller) and control (controller-to-actuator) channels carried out by an intelligent adversary. We characterize the duration of these interruptions under which stability of the closed-loop system is preserved. The resilient nature of the control descends from its ability to adapt the sampling rate to the occurrence of the DoS."

This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

The control scheme was scaled up to a multimode multiplant arrangement with coordination among loops. To examine the wireless control loop performance, we use the rotating base variation of the linear inverted pendulum. Using the wireless control loop, we can examine a number of the characteristics of UDP data transmission over 802.11b.},

We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

  abstract    = {Virtual evaluation of complex Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) [1] with a number of tightly integrated domains such as physical, mechanical, electrical, thermal, cyber, etc. demand the use of heterogeneous simulation environments. Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

	Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.},

For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.},

These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a decomposition method for evaluating the performance of continuous flow lines with machines characterized by general Markovian fluid models and finite capacity buffers is proposed. This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.},

  abstract  = {Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS."

	economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of 
	
	high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to 
	
	remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while 
	
	maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in 
	
	manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control 
	
	architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the 
	
	current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and 
	
	adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic 
	
	manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, 
	
	decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing 
	
	control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic 
	
	manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these 
	
	approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future."

	abstract={Cyber-physical systems are systems governed by the laws of physics that are tightly controlled by computer-based algorithms and network-based sensing and actuation. Wireless communication technology is envisioned to play a primary role in conducting the information flows within such systems. A practical industrial wireless use case involving a robot manipulator control system, an integrated wireless force-torque sensor, and a remote vision-based observer is constructed and the performance of the cyber-physical system is examined. By using readings from the remote observer, an estimation system is developed using machine learning regression techniques. We demonstrate the practicality of combining statistical analysis with machine learning to indirectly estimate signal-to-interference of the wireless communication link using measurements from the remote observer. Results from the statistical analysis and the performance of the machine learning system are presented.},

	abstract={Wireless communications plays an essential role in the future cyber-physical systems vision which includes having more sensors and actuators, and, hence, more information transferred through wireless. In this article, we consider an industrial use case of a robot arm control system equipped with a force-torque sensor. Movement of the arm is tracked by a vision-based ground truth measurement system. Movement of the arm is controlled by a robot controller applying a downward pressure on a spring assembly until a predetermined force is detected. The remote vision-based observer provides readings about the position of the robot arm where these readings are used to estimate the signal-to-interference ratio of the wireless link. A supervised machine learning approach is used for the wireless channel quality estimation. In this paper, we study the impact of various system features on the performance of various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the training and the estimation period on the performance of the proposed approach. The results provide insights about the impact of wireless communications on cyber-physical systems and an example of employing machine learning to improve industrial wireless deployments.},

	abstract={The manufacturing industry is at the edge of the fourth industrial revolution, a paradigm of integrated architectures in which the entire production chain (composed of machines, workers, and products) is intrinsically connected. Wireless technologies can add further value in this manufacturing revolution. However, we identify some signs which indicate that wireless technology could be left out of the next generation of smart factory equipment. This is particularly relevant considering that the heavy machinery characteristic of this sector can last for decades. We argue that at the core of this issue there is a mismatch between industrial needs and the interests of academic and partly academic sectors (e.g., standardization bodies). We base our claims on surveys from renowned advisory firms and interviews with industrial actors, which we contrast with results from content analysis of scientific articles. Finally, we propose some convergence paths that, while still retaining the degree of novelty required for academic purposes, are more aligned with industrial concerns.},
