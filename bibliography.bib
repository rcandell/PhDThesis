	abstract     = {In wireless communications, the relative strength of the direct and scattered components of the received signal, as expressed by the Ricean K factor, provides an indication of link quality. Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

	abstract     = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.},

Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.}

Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.}

In this paper, three approaches to safety are examined: fault trees (FT), Bayesian networks (BN), and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). A case study of a propane feed control system is used to apply these methods. In order to make safety improvements to industrial workplaces high understanding of the systems is required. It is shown that consideration of the chance of failure of the system components, as in the \{FT\} and \{BN\} approaches, may not provide enough understanding to fully inform safety assessments. The \{FT\} and \{BN\} methods are top-down approaches that are formed from the perspective of management in workplaces. The \{FRAM\} methodology uses a bottom-up approach from the operational perspective to improve the understanding of the industrial workplace. The \{FRAM\} approach can provide added insight to the human factor and context and increase the rate at which we learn by considering successes as well as failures. \{FRAM\} can be a valuable tool for industrial safety assessment and to consider industrial safety holistically, by providing a framework to examine the operations in detail. However, operations should be considered using both top-down and bottom-up perspectives and all operational experience to make the most informed safety decisions.}

With a monitoring network of 20 wireless devices covering 200 m2, 60 propane releases are performed. The detection and localization algorithms proposed here are applied to the collected concentration data, and the methodology is evaluated. A detection rate of 91% is achieved, with seven false alarms recorded over 3 days, and an average detection delay of 108 s. The localization results show an accuracy of 5 m. Recommendations for future explosive gas sensor design are then presented.},

Moreover, in order to optimize production, humans and robots are expected to collaborate to some extent. In this scenario, involving a shared environment between humans and robots, common motion generation algorithms might turn out to be inadequate for this purpose. This paper proposes a kinematic control strategy which enforces safety, while maintaining the maximum level of productivity of the robot. The resulting motion of the (possibly redundant) robot is obtained as an output of an optimization-based real-time algorithm in which safety is regarded as a hard constraint to be satisfied. The methodology is experimentally validated on a dual-arm concept robot with 7-DOF per arm performing a manipulation task.},

This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.}

This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.}

	abstract     = {Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.}

	abstract     = {Systems engineers must understand how all the parts of a digital system work together, including hardware AND software. SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract     = {The successful introduction of flexible, reconfigurable and self-adaptive manufacturing processes relies upon evolving traditional automation ISA-95 automation solutions to adopt innovative automation pyramids. These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.}

Existing methods either rely on segmentation or are restricted to direct estimation of the left ventricle. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct and joint volume estimation of bi-ventricles, i.e., the left and right ventricles, without segmentation and user inputs. Based on the cardiac image representation by multiple and complementary features, we adopt regression forests to jointly estimate the two volumes. Our method is validated on a dataset of 56 subjects with a total of 3360 MR images which shows that our method can achieve a high correlation coefficient of around 0.9 with manual segmentation obtained by human experts. With our proposed method, the most daily-used estimation of cardiac function, e.g., ejection fraction, can be conducted in a much more efficient, accurate and convenient way.}

This paper proposes a new robust {\$}{\$}R^2{\$}{\$}R2measure that is found to work better than existing measures across scenarios.

	abstract     = {The second edition of this handbook provides a state-of-the-art cover view on the various aspects in the rapidly developing field of robotics. Reaching for the human frontier, robotics is vigorously engaged in the growing challenges of new emerging domains. Interacting, exploring, and working with humans, the new generation of robots will increasingly touch people and their lives. The credible prospect of practical robots among humans is the result of the scientific endeavour of a half a century of robotic developments that established robotics as a modern scientific discipline. The ongoing vibrant expansion and strong growth of the field during the last decade has fueled this second edition of the Springer Handbook of Robotics. The first edition of the handbook soon became a landmark in robotics publishing and won the American Association of Publishers PROSE Award for Excellence in Physical Sciences {\&} Mathematics as well as the organization's Award for Engineering {\&} Technology. The second edition of the handbook, edited by two internationally renowned scientists with the support of an outstanding team of seven part editors and more than 200 authors, continues to be an authoritative reference for robotics researchers, newcomers to the field, and scholars from related disciplines. The contents have been restructured to achieve four main objectives: the enlargement of foundational topics for robotics, the enlightenment of design of various types of robotic systems, the extension of the treatment on robots moving in the environment, and the enrichment of advanced robotics applications. Further to an extensive update, fifteen new chapters have been introduced on emerging topics, and a new generation of authors have joined the handbook's team. A novel addition to the second edition is a comprehensive collection of multimedia references to more than 700 videos, which bring valuable insight into the contents. The videos can be viewed directly augmented into the text with a smartphone or tablet using a unique and specially designed app.},

Our article is written in recognition of the 100th anniversary of Galton's first discussion of regression and correlation. We begin with a brief history. Then we present 13 different formulas, each of which represents a different computational and conceptual definition of r. Each formula suggests a different way of thinking about this index, from algebraic, geometric, and trigonometric settings. We show that Pearson's r (or simple functions of r) may variously be thought of as a special type of mean, a special type of variance, the ratio of two means, the ratio of two variances, the slope of a line, the cosine of an angle, and the tangent to an ellipse, and may be looked at from several other interesting perspectives.},

	abstract     = {—The ever-growing proliferation of wireless devices and technologies used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as patient monitoring, military surveillance, and industrial automation and control, has created an increasing need for methods and tools for connectivity prediction, information flow monitoring, and failure analysis to increase the dependability of the wireless network. Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we share our experience in troubleshooting coexistence problems in operational IIoT networks by reporting on examples that show the possible hurdles in carrying out failure analysis. Our experience motivates the need for a user-friendly, automated failure analysis system, and we outline an architecture of such system that allows to observe multiple com-munication standards and unknown sources of interference.}

	abstract     = {With the recent growth of the graph-based data, the large graph processing becomes more and more important. In order to explore and to extract knowledge from such data, graph mining methods, like community detection, is a necessity. Although the graph mining is a relatively recent development in the Data Mining domain, it has been studied extensively in different areas (biology, social networks, telecommunications and Internet). The legacy graph processing tools mainly rely on single machine computational capacity, which cannot process large graph with billions of nodes. Therefore, the main challenge of new tools and frameworks lies on the development of new paradigms that are scalable, efficient and flexible. In this paper, we will review the new paradigms of large graph processing and their applications to graph mining domain using the distributed and shared nothing approach used for large data by Internet players. The paper will be organized as a walk through different industrial needs in terms of graph mining passing by the existing solutions. Finally, we will expose a set of open research questions linked with several new business requirements as the graph data warehouse.}

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.}

	abstract     = {Accurate estimation of ventricular volumes plays an essential role in clinical diagnosis of cardiac diseases. Existing methods either rely on segmentation or are restricted to direct estimation of the left ventricle. In this paper, we propose a novel method for direct and joint volume estimation of bi-ventricles, i.e., the left and right ventricles, without segmentation and user inputs. Based on the cardiac image representation by multiple and complementary features, we adopt regression forests to jointly estimate the two volumes. Our method is validated on a dataset of 56 subjects with a total of 3360 MR images which shows that our method can achieve a high correlation coefficient of around 0.9 with manual segmentation obtained by human experts. With our proposed method, the most daily-used estimation of cardiac function, e.g., ejection fraction, can be conducted in a much more efficient, accurate and convenient way.}

This paper proposes a new robust {\$}{\$}R^2{\$}{\$}R2measure that is found to work better than existing measures across scenarios. Performance superiority has been demonstrated using extensive simulation results and three real publicly available datasets.

	abstract     = {—The ever-growing proliferation of wireless devices and technologies used for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, such as patient monitoring, military surveillance, and industrial automation and control, has created an increasing need for methods and tools for connectivity prediction, information flow monitoring, and failure analysis to increase the dependability of the wireless network. Indeed, in a safety-critical Industrial IoT (IIoT) setting, such as a smart factory, harsh signal propagation conditions combined with interference from coexisting radio technologies operating in the same frequency band may lead to poor network performance or even application failures despite precautionary measures. Analyzing and troubleshooting such failures on a large scale is often difficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we share our experience in troubleshooting coexistence problems in operational IIoT networks by reporting on examples that show the possible hurdles in carrying out failure analysis. Our experience motivates the need for a user-friendly, automated failure analysis system, and we outline an architecture of such system that allows to observe multiple com-munication standards and unknown sources of interference.}

	abstract     = {Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication is one of the vertical sectors that will benefit from 5G communication systems, but today, these systems are still dominated by technologies such as ZigBee and WiFi. An M2M scenario will experience dense deployment of ZigBee and WiFi nodes in order to route the data from one end to the other. In the 2.4 GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band, both of the technologies perform co-channel overlapped operation and hence face severe cross technology co-channel interference (CCI). In contrast to cellular systems, which solve the CCI by centralized coordination through the base station, addressing CCI in the ISM band is non-trivial due to heterogeneous wireless technologies and the lack of centralized coordination. In this work, we first present interference mitigating receiver architectures for OFDM-based WiFi using single and multiple antennas. Our single antenna work is based on the localized estimation of excess noise caused by single and multiple co-channel narrowband interferers and scaling the log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) of the affected WiFi subcarriers. The simulation shows our method achieves a significant gain in SNR compared to the conventional method for a given packet error rate (PER) criterion. Next, we discuss maximal ratio combiner with LLR scaling (MLSC), which is a multi-antenna extension to our previous work. The simulation shows MLSC achieves diversity gain apart from the gain in SNR. Further, we propose soft-bit maximal ratio combiner with LLR scaling (SB-MLSC). SB-MLSC is an easy to implement version of MLSC. However, diversity combining in SB-MLSC is performed by combining the LLRs. Nonetheless, simulations show equivalence in performance by SB-MLSC and MLSC. Finally, as a significant part of this work, we implemented all our methods using a software-defined radio (SDR) and performed over-the-air (OTA) testing in the 2.4-GHz ISM band using standard WiFi and ZigBee frames. Results of OTA tests fall in complete agreement with our simulations indicating the practical applicability of our methods. Our methods apply to all the standards and related radio transmission techniques which are based on OFDM and face narrowband co-channel interference. Additionally, since our work focuses only on receiver side modifications, they can be integrated with the existing infrastructure with minimal modifications.}

A kind of unsupervised machine learning algorithm is proposed, which can independently identify and select the optimal eigenvalue without relying on the prior information. First, the wave signal filtering is reduced and processed by kernelized principle component analysis (KPCA) algorithm. Then, the eigenvalues are selected and the redundant features are eliminated by adaptive parameter adjustment denoising auto-encoder (APADAE) algorithm. Finally, the feature vectors are classified and identified by Softmax algorithm and the classification process are optimized by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Experimental results of the Smart Cyber-Physical systems show that the algorithm can indirectly improve the accuracy of the source location based on improving the classification accuracy.}

By DoS attacks we mean interruptions of communication on measurement (sensor-to-controller) and control (controller-to-actuator) channels carried out by an intelligent adversary. We characterize the duration of these interruptions under which stability of the closed-loop system is preserved. The resilient nature of the control descends from its ability to adapt the sampling rate to the occurrence of the DoS.}

	abstract     = {Recent advances in manufacturing industry has paved way for a systematical deployment of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), within which information from all related perspectives is closely monitored and synchronized between the physical factory floor and the cyber computational space. Moreover, by utilizing advanced information analytics, networked machines will be able to perform more efficiently, collaboratively and resiliently. Such trend is transforming manufacturing industry to the next generation, namely Industry 4.0. At this early development phase, there is an urgent need for a clear definition of CPS. In this paper, a unified 5-level architecture is proposed as a guideline for implementation of CPS.}

	abstract     = {Manufacturing has faced significant changes during the last years, namely the move from a local economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future.}

A practical industrial wireless use case involving a robot manipulator control system, an integrated wireless force-torque sensor, and a remote vision-based observer is constructed and the performance of the cyber-physical system is examined. By using readings from the remote observer, an estimation system is developed using machine learning regression techniques. We demonstrate the practicality of combining statistical analysis with machine learning to indirectly estimate signal-to-interference of the wireless communication link using measurements from the remote observer. Results from the statistical analysis and the performance of the machine learning system are presented.},

In this article, we consider an industrial use case of a robot arm control system equipped with a force-torque sensor. Movement of the arm is tracked by a vision-based ground truth measurement system. Movement of the arm is controlled by a robot controller applying a downward pressure on a spring assembly until a predetermined force is detected. The remote vision-based observer provides readings about the position of the robot arm where these readings are used to estimate the signal-to-interference ratio of the wireless link. A supervised machine learning approach is used for the wireless channel quality estimation. In this paper, we study the impact of various system features on the performance of various machine learning algorithms and compare their performance. Moreover, we investigate the impact of the training and the estimation period on the performance of the proposed approach. The results provide insights about the impact of wireless communications on cyber-physical systems and an example of employing machine learning to improve industrial wireless deployments.},

Wireless technologies can add further value in this manufacturing revolution.

This is particularly relevant considering that the heavy machinery characteristic of this sector can last for decades. We argue that at the core of this issue there is a mismatch between industrial needs and the interests of academic and partly academic sectors (e.g., standardization bodies). We base our claims on surveys from renowned advisory firms and interviews with industrial actors, which we contrast with results from content analysis of scientific articles. Finally, we propose some convergence paths that, while still retaining the degree of novelty required for academic purposes, are more aligned with industrial concerns.},

	abstract     = {The Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) is an infrastructure comprised of sensing, computing, and communication devices, that obtain and process data to help understand the behavior of the monitored environment, and to react to events and phenomena that occur in it. The WSN can be used in domains such as agriculture, energy, industrial automation, medical health care, smart building, and so on. In industry, the characteristics of the wireless channel are different in comparison to other WSN environments, such as home and office environments. The use of WSN in industry is subject to typical problems of wireless communications, such as noise, shadowing, multipath fading and interference. In addition, the wireless channel in many industrial environments is non-stationary for a long term, which can cause abrupt changes in the characteristics of the channel over time. A set of standards was developed for industrial WSN, to overcome these limitations, such as WirelessHART, ISA100.11a, WIA-PA, and IEEE 802.15.4e. All the mentioned standards are based on the IEEE 802.15.4 physical layer, but define different mechanisms for the upper layers. However, according to recent publications, problems still can arise in the deployment of networks that follow the standards, because of multipath effects, and interference. This survey provides a structured overview of the standards used to implement industrial WSN, their advantages and drawbacks, and discusses the characteristics of the wireless channel in industrial environments. Finally, a systematic mapping is described, that presents results of publications about industrial WSN, and highlights important topics to be studied in this field.}

A new testbed was recently designed and developed to facilitate such studies in work-cells by replicating various data flows in an emulated production environment. In this paper, an approach to storing and analyzing network performance data from a manufacturing factory work-cell is introduced. A robotic testbed was constructed using two collaborative grade robot arms, machine emulators, and wireless communication devices. A graph database approach was implemented to capture network flight data and operational event data among the actors within the testbed. A proposed schema is developed and elaborated, the database is then populated with events from the tested, the resulting graph is presented. Query commands are then presented as a means to examine and analyze network performance and relationships within the actors of the network. Additionally, we demonstrate how to extract correlations between receive signal power and network delay within the testbed using the graph database query language. Finally, using the inherent interconnected nature of the graph database, we discuss applying the graph database approach toward examining more complex relationships between the wireless communications network and the operational system.},

Main challenges of wireless deployment include the stochastic nature of the wireless channels and the harsh industrial transmission environment. In this work, a typical two-dimensional gantry system is controlled by a local controller which receives G-code commands wirelessly over a Wi-Fi network. The industrial wireless channel is replicated using a radio frequency (RF) channel emulator where various scenarios are considered and various wireless channel parameters are studied. The movement of the gantry system tool is tracked using a vision tracking system to quantify the impact of the wireless channel on the system performance. Numerical results are presented including the total run time of an industrial process and the dwell times at various positions through the process.}",

	abstract = "{Wireless communication is a key enabling technology central to the advancement of the goals of the Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing concept. Researchers at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) are constructing a testbed to aid in the adoption of wireless technology within the factory workcell and other harsh industrial radio environments. In this paper the authors present a new industrial wireless testbed design that motivates academic research and is relevant to the needs of industry. The testbed is deigned to serve as both a demonstration and research platform for the wireless workcell. The work leverages lessons learned from past incarnations that included a dual robot machine tending scenario and a force-torque seeking robot arm apparatus. This version of the testbed includes computational and communication elements such that the operation of the physical system is noticeably degraded under the influence of radio interference, competing network traffic, and radio propagation effects applied within the lab. Key performance indicators of the testbed are selected and presented which include communication, computational, and physical systems indicators. The testbed includes two collaborative grade robot arms, programmable logical controllers, and high-performance computing devices for situational tracking, alerting, and control. Important topics presented include use case selection, middleware candidate selection (ROS/ROS2), and the selection of protocols for the study of high-reliability, low-latency communication solutions. Data products and machine learning application opportunities are explored. The paper is aimed to provide our contribution to the exploration of industrial wireless testbed design while soliciting feedback from fellow researchers.}",
