abstract = {In many radio propagation environments, a line of sight (LoS) component exists between the transmitter and the receiver. This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

The timing scheme was implemented using standard PCs and an 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless network. The control scheme was scaled up to a multimode multiplant arrangement with coordination among loops. To examine the wireless control loop performance, we use the rotating base variation of the linear inverted pendulum. Using the wireless control loop, we can examine a number of the characteristics of UDP data transmission over 802.11b.},

While CCA itself is implemented at the PHY layer, the primary impact of its performance/complexity is on MAC metrics like throughput and energy efficiency; this cross-layer dependency makes it necessary to enhance MAC protocol performance evaluation by considering the specifics of CCA implementation that are naturally link-dependant. We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

abstract = { In wireless communications, the relative strength of the direct and scattered components of the received signal, as expressed by the Ricean K factor, provides an indication of link quality. Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

@article{Rappaport1989,
abstract = {Wide-band multipath measurements at 1300 MHz have been made in five factory buildings in Indiana. Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

abstract = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

In this paper, the main methodologies suggested in the literature to cope with typical network-induced constraints, namely time delays, packet losses and disorder, time-varying transmission intervals, competition of multiple nodes accessing networks, and data quantization are surveyed; the constraints suggested in the literature on the first two types of constraints are updated in different categorizing ways; and those on the latter three types of constraints are extended.},

Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.",

abstract="We evaluate the performance of realistic wireless sensor networks in indoor scenarios. Most of the considered networks are formed by nodes using the Zigbee communication protocol. For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.",

In this paper, three approaches to safety are examined: fault trees (FT), Bayesian networks (BN), and the Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM). A case study of a propane feed control system is used to apply these methods. In order to make safety improvements to industrial workplaces high understanding of the systems is required. It is shown that consideration of the chance of failure of the system components, as in the \{FT\} and \{BN\} approaches, may not provide enough understanding to fully inform safety assessments. The \{FT\} and \{BN\} methods are top-down approaches that are formed from the perspective of management in workplaces. The \{FRAM\} methodology uses a bottom-up approach from the operational perspective to improve the understanding of the industrial workplace. The \{FRAM\} approach can provide added insight to the human factor and context and increase the rate at which we learn by considering successes as well as failures. \{FRAM\} can be a valuable tool for industrial safety assessment and to consider industrial safety holistically, by providing a framework to examine the operations in detail. However, operations should be considered using both top-down and bottom-up perspectives and all operational experience to make the most informed safety decisions. "

title={Wireless Gas Leak Detection and Localization},

pages={768-779}, 
abstract={Thousands of industrial gas leaks occur every year, with many leading to injuries, deaths, equipment damage, and a disastrous environmental effect. There have been many attempts at solving this problem, but with limited success. This paper proposes a wireless gas leak detection and localization solution. With a monitoring network of 20 wireless devices covering 200 m2, 60 propane releases are performed. The detection and localization algorithms proposed here are applied to the collected concentration data, and the methodology is evaluated. A detection rate of 91% is achieved, with seven false alarms recorded over 3 days, and an average detection delay of 108 s. The localization results show an accuracy of 5 m. Recommendations for future explosive gas sensor design are then presented.},

abstract={New paradigms in industrial robotics no longer require physical separation between robotic manipulators and humans. Moreover, in order to optimize production, humans and robots are expected to collaborate to some extent. In this scenario, involving a shared environment between humans and robots, common motion generation algorithms might turn out to be inadequate for this purpose. This paper proposes a kinematic control strategy which enforces safety, while maintaining the maximum level of productivity of the robot. The resulting motion of the (possibly redundant) robot is obtained as an output of an optimization-based real-time algorithm in which safety is regarded as a hard constraint to be satisfied. The methodology is experimentally validated on a dual-arm concept robot with 7-DOF per arm performing a manipulation task.},

abstract={The evolution of wireless communication from 4G toward 5G is driven by application demands and business models envisioned for 2020 and beyond. This requires network support for novel use cases in addition to classical mobile broadband services. Wireless factory automation is an application area with highly demanding communication requirements. We classify these requirements and identify the opportunities for the current LTE air interface for factory automation applications. Moreover, we give an outlook on the relevant design considerations to be addressed by 5G communication systems.},

abstract={The large bandwidth available at the mmWave spectrum can open the way for a wide variety of new industrial automation capabilities. With the use of wireless smart cameras and vision technologies, applications such as remote visual monitoring and surveillance, intelligent logistics product tracking, image guided automated assembly, and fault detection can be realized. Vision capabilities can enable robots, machines, and other industrial automation systems to meaningfully interact with objects and safely navigate through their surroundings. Allowing them to adapt to changing manufacturing-line conditions opens a wide range of new industrial automation applications. In this article, we discuss the opportunities, challenges, and design principles of industrial wireless communication over the mmWave spectrum. Open research issues are identified and discussed. In addition, performance analysis of mmWave industrial systems with respect to channel capacity is conducted using a realistic physical-statistical-based channel model.},
