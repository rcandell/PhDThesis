		Smart Manufacturing, also known as Industry 4.0, provides a vision of future manufacturing systems that incorporate highly dynamic physical systems, robust and responsive communications systems, and computing paradigms to maximize efficiency, enable mobility, and realize the promises of the digital factory.  Wireless technology is a key enabler of that vision. A comprehensive graphical model is developed for a generic wireless factory work-cell which employs the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), a standardized and semantically rich modeling language, to link the physical and network domains in such a cyber-physical system (CPS). Our model identifies the structural primitives, interfaces, and behaviors of the highly-connected factory work-cell in which wireless technology is used for significant data flows involved in control algorithms. The model includes the parametric definitions to encapsulate information loss, delay, and mutation associated with the wireless network, and it identifies pertinent wireless information flows.

	\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}    
	The fourth industrial revolution, commonly referred to as Smart Manufacturing in the U.S. and Industry 4.0 in Europe, promises unparalleled productivity and capability advances in manufacturing.  Propelled by economic pressure toward greater efficiency, factory agility, and product customization, future factories will have the technological ability to adapt to customer demands quickly, modify manufacturing processes automatically based on quality feedback, and fabricate products with a reduced environmental impact.  Technological advances required for smart manufacturing to be successful include collaborative and mobile robotics, distributed machine autonomy based on artificial intelligence, improved process observability, and a high degree of interconnectivity among automation resources. Work-cells are self-contained units of operation within a factory.  These work-cells are composed of various machines, conveyors, motors, edge devices, and robots.  Robots will work together and with people to accomplish complex tasks or to tending to other machines within the work-cell.  Robots will have the ability to roam between work-cells within a factory, learn their roles quickly, become aware of edge devices, and communicate with other actors within the work-cell to accomplish their goals. Efficient communications between robots and the other players in the work-cell are essential to the fulfillment of the robot-related tasks.
	
	Current manufacturing architectures use wired connections through field-bus and industrial Ethernet protocols for sensing and real-time control.  Indeed, through advances in time-sensitive networking, many of the promises of smart manufacturing are being realized; however, the true goals of smart manufacturing require a large deployment of sensing and actuation devices and mobile, perhaps autonomous, robotics actors.  The use of wires precludes mobility and makes deployment of edge devices more expensive as each  requires power, cables, and conduit for communication. By adopting wireless for both sensing and control of machines within the work-cell, a lower-cost, untethered operation is achievable\footnote{The power for untethered operation can be achieved through the use of rechargeable batteries to power the untethered machine or robot for enough operating period.}. Once wireless is adopted as the primary mode of communication, questions arise as to the required latency, reliability, and scale of the wireless network especially when the network is used for the control of machines and the assurance of safety. 
	
	The work presented here addresses the present need for a comprehensive architectural model of the factory work-cell in which wireless is a preferred mechanism for carrying information within the work-cell. We begin with an architectural analysis of the future collaborative work-cell that includes edge devices, robotics, vision, and supervisory controllers. Our architectural analysis includes structural components, information flows, and parametric elements of the work-cell. We identify factors that limit reliability, latency, and scale of the wireless network, and we conclude with a discussion of significant information flows. Significant information flows are defined as operationally critical or safety-related.  Our contributions are:
    
\begin{itemize}
\item[$\star$] First, we develop a comprehensive and extensible architectural model using Systems Modeling Language (SysML) that provides primitives for describing the physical and networking components of a work-cell with parametric constraints\footnote{We make the model publicly available for download. A valid license of MagicDraw 18.5 is required to use the model.  A web-based report of the model is provided for read-only access.};
\item[$\star$] Second, we provide a framework for analyzing cross-domain interactions of complex wireless work-cell deployments; and
\item[$\star$] Third, significant information flows are identified, annotated with rate constraints.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows:  In Section~\ref{sec:related-work}, previous related work is discussed and our motivation for constructing a model is presented.  A brief introduction to systems modeling is presented in Section~\ref{sec:systemsmodeling} and provides a primer on the SysML language. The conceptual architecture of the model providing a concept-of-usage is proposed in Section~\ref{sec:conceptual}, followed by a detailed exposition of each package in Section~\ref{sec:detailed-model}.  Then, in Section~\ref{sec:wireless-infoflows}, significant information flows are discussed. Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the paper and identifies opportunities for future research.
	
	\section{Related Work}\label{sec:related-work}

    %In a work-cell, people work closely with robot co-workers to operate machine tools in the production process. 
    
    Current modeling work on factory work-cells is mainly aimed at defining and characterizing the subsystems, such as human staff, robots, and machine tools, in individual applications. By following blueprints (schematics) of production tasks, the work flow can be divided into separate assignments which are distributed by a task dispatch system to individual machines~\cite{IkeaBot}. Analytical models are thus obtained for performance analysis in work-cells. As an example, a mathematical model for real-time performance analysis of a gantry work-cell with robots is proposed in \cite{8098604,OU2017212}. The timing and the randomness of tasks and disruptions are captured in the introduced model in a generic mathematical approach. Similarly, the steady state analysis for production lines with uncertainties can be found in \cite{Colledani2013,doi:10.1080/00207543.2012.713137,doi:10.1080/00207540500385980}. The performance analysis modeling for serial production lines with disruption impacts is explored in \cite{QChang,Liu2012}. 
In these models, the reconfigurable work-cell architecture is widely considered for automated manufacturing. The main advantage of reconfigurable work-cells lies in the flexibility of reconfiguration of work-cell components to adapt to varying production requirements. The optimization of the assembly configuration for specific task is discussed in \cite{CHEN2001199}. In the work-cell that hosts robots, robots are installed therein to allow for autonomous configuration within their workspace \cite{8023523,10.1007/978-3-319-65151-4_10,6059204}. The development of reconfigurable robotic systems has been documented in \cite{Fulea}. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has defined a Network of Things (NoT) model which can depict the structure of work-cells by a group of NoT building blocks and model the behaviors of individual components in a work-cell~\cite{NIST800-183}.  The NIST NoT model is focused primarily on sensor networks and the collection of data.  Actuation is cursorily noted, and, as such, cross-domain interactions between the physical system and the network are not addressed. Several other robotic work-cell architectures are proposed such as \cite{OpenArch,CARPANZANO2007435}. 

In a work-cell model, data flows are used to capture the trajectory of system information exchange between work-cell components and identify their roles in specific operations~\cite{CARPANZANO2007435}. 
For example, safety-related operations employ the vision system and various proximity sensors that generate proximity data and transmit them to the safety manager to define safety zones in an automotive assembly work-cell~\cite{safeeye}. 
In another example, data flows are enabled in a work-cell to capture human operator gestures from embedded cameras in human-robot collaborations~\cite{cobotcell}. These gestures can be later regenerated in simulators based on the transmitted position data from the field to optimize work-cell safety operations~\cite{gesture}. Currently, most of the work-cell information in these scenarios are transmitted by wired networks.


Wireless networks have gained increasing interests to enable data flows in the highly connected work-cells.
Wireless standard bodies have proposed their network reference models in factory environments which include the work-cell cases in the data-centric architecture~\cite{ETSI889, KPItable}. In these models, individual work-cells are treated as a subnetwork of field instruments attached with data aggregations that manage network connections and transfer data traffic to edge and cloud servers in various applications.
Wireless connections are featured with flexible network topology to agree with a variety of transmission needs, especially in reconfigurable work-cells. Meanwhile, data traffic flows are characterized by select performance metrics, such as transmission latency and link reliability, to categorize industrial use cases~\cite{KPItable}. 

Current modeling efforts set the boundaries of their systems of study at the edge devices without further discussions on the impact of wireless performance on the operations of industrial systems. For example, the abstracted disruptions in \cite{QChang,Liu2012} that cause plant downtimes may include wireless network impacts which are not yet treated distinguishably with specific characteristics of wireless networks. As indicated by the earlier empirical studies~\cite{LIU2017412}, such physical systems may have different responses to network performance which will vary with the operational configuration such as the served ``application'' and the deployed control algorithms. In this paper, we incorporate the features of wireless communications networks into the modeling architecture of physical work-cells such that cross-domain interactions may be studied.
    
	\section{Systems Modeling Using SysML}\label{sec:systemsmodeling}
	SysML is a general purpose modeling language that is often used for model-based systems engineering (MBSE) practice within industrial systems. The goal of creating a model is the capture of knowledge of a process in a simplified way.  A secondary goal of a model is to provide a level of abstraction that may allow for the discovery of new knowledge such as how two systems will interact.  Well-behaved systems may be modeled with a system of equations.  Such models provide excellent constraint definition, but lack the semantics to describe architecture and detailed information flow.  With functional block diagrams, we are able to capture major functional components and flow of information or material, but the architecture and interfaces remain at a very high level of abstraction making analysis difficult. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:fbd-system}, a physical process interacts with a control system through a wireless network.  Measured values, $Y$, from sensors flow to the controller through a wireless network and arrive at the controller delayed and modified, $\bar{Y}$.  Similarly, commands, $U$, flows from the controller to the actuators through the wireless network.  Such diagrams may be used to model feedback control systems in which the origination and routing of information are immaterial for study. In such cases, delay and loss using such tools are often modeled stochastically.
    
    Architectural diagrams identify components, interfaces, and information flow, but they lack the semantics necessary to describe the constraints that formal equations and functional block diagrams offer.  For factory systems, architectural block diagrams are often manifested as schematics and thus lack the capability of capturing behavior or complex interactions between the physical system and the information infrastructure such as a wireless network.  Schematic capture diagrams lack the semantics to jointly capture architecture, information flow, and parametric constraints together. 
    
    \begin{figure}
    	\centering
        \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{diagrams/fbd-system}
        \caption{Functional block diagram of a cyber-physical system in which a physical process and an automation system interact through a wireless network.}
        \label{fig:fbd-system}
    \end{figure}
    
    An alternative to schematic diagrams is SysML. SysML provides structural, behavioral, and parametric semantics for the analysis of complex systems.  Systems analysis using SysML provides a means of capturing and communicating system requirements and design to include hardware, software, firmware, information, and process using graphical notation.  Within the factory automation industry, engineers are adopting SysML in the form of MBSE to develop realizable operational models of the factory and data flow processes.  MBSE models address verification of design through executable simulations depending on the modeling tool.  The SysML specification is defined in~\cite{SysML2017}.  In SysML, the basic semantic constructs of the language are Packages, Blocks, Ports, Interfaces, and Constraints, in addition to the constructs provided by the Unified Modeling Language (UML). Packages are logical grouping of model elements. Package relationships are captured using the package diagram (PKG). Relationships of these constructs are captured in the block definition diagram (BDD).  The internal composition and connectivity of parts are captured in the internal block diagram (IBD). SysML includes other types of diagrams and semantic constructs that are not required for this analysis and are not explained here. The SysML model is comprehensive; however, the size and number of diagrams within the model are too extensive to include within this paper.  Therefore, the reader is encouraged to explore the SysML model defined in~\cite{SysML.Candell2018}.  A useful primer on SysML may be found in~\cite{Friedenthal2015.SysML}.  
    
 	While various architectures for the work-cell exist as exemplified in the literature, a common language and framework for communicating architecture and information flow has not been established for cross-domain interactions between the manufacturing system and its supporting communication networks.  SysML contains the semantics for such engineering capture and provides an industry accepted language for communicating composition, interfaces, and information flow. Moreover, SysML provides the semantics for assigning properties to any model element such that those properties are made  available for analysis using other tools such as Prot\'eg\'e ~\cite{StanfordUniversity.Protege} and the Web Ontology Language (OWL)~\cite{W3C2012.OWL}. It is important to understand that while SysML provides semantics for a formal capture of architecture, information flow, and parametric constraints, it may also be used for a higher-degree of abstraction provided by the functional block diagrams.  The remainder of this work describes a reusable model for representing a comprehensive wireless factory work-cell using the semantic constructs of SysML. When discussing the model, the SysML term, \textit{block}, is omitted for the sake of brevity where the meaning is clear.
	
	\section{Conceptual Representation}\label{sec:conceptual}
	\subsection{Packages}
	The factory work-cell is decomposed into one general and nine major structural packages as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:pdd-workcell}.  Packages include major logical groupings of structure within the model.  These packages are enumerated in the following paragraphs.
	
	\begin{figure}[t]
		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{diagrams/pkg__Factory_Workcell__Workcell}%
			\caption{SysML package diagram showing the logical containment of the factory work-cell structural elements.}%
			\label{fig:pdd-workcell}
		\end{center}
	\end{figure}
	
	
	\subsubsection{General} A set of reusable structural elements that is used for conceptual modeling or extended to produce more complex model elements.  Each of the sub-packages within the General package extend basic features.  The sub-packages within General include time and constraints for data, electro-magnetics, and motion.
	
	\subsubsection{Network} Describes the components, blocks, interfaces, and limiting factors of the industrial wireless network (IWN).  The IWN is modeled as the radio channel and the services provided by the network. Limiting factors are modeled as parametric equations associated with the radio channel and the services.
	
	\subsubsection{Application}  This package contains the model elements describing a component of behavioral functionality typically implemented within software or firmware but could be implemented in hardware.  It describes the features and constraints of factory operation such as the logic of a supervisory controller or the feedback controller of a robot arm.  The Application sets the performance requirements of the wireless network, i.e., the factory network performance requirements are derived from the requirements of the applications deployed to a work-cell.
	
	\subsubsection{Devices} Describes the types of devices found within the factory work-cell to include any device that interacts with the environment such as wired and wireless input-output (IO) devices including sensors and actuators.
	
	\subsubsection{Robotics} Describes the computational and communicative components of robot control including sensing, actuation, and command.  Description of the robot itself is inconsequential to communication and therefore not included in the model.
	
	\subsubsection{PLC} Describes the supervisory control components commonly handled by one or more programmable logic controller (PLC) components.  This package includes the elements responsible for coordination of actors and handling of most input-output.
	
	\subsubsection{Safety} Describes the allocation of safety qualities typically included in the supervisory controller.  The Safety package includes devices, monitoring, and actuation of the safety behaviors within the factory work-cell.
	
	\subsubsection{Vision} Describes the allocation of features to optical monitoring and tracking which are typical to the collaborative robotic work-cell.
	
	\subsubsection{Spectrum Monitoring System (SMS)} Describes the qualities and interfaces of a factory spectrum monitoring system projected into the factory work-cell.  The SMS includes monitoring nodes and agents localized to the work-cell and connected to the automation system for real-time adaptation to changing multi-path and interference. 
	
	\subsubsection{Human} Describes the features associated with human beings such as human motion, tasks, and carried equipment such as portable computing and communication devices.
	\vspace{3mm} 
    
    Several examples of how to use the model are provided within the model\cite{SysML.Candell2018}.  Examples include: a robotic force-torque leader-follower, a robotic force-torque limiter, a collision avoidance, and a robotic pick and place work-cell.  The parametric constraints are provided as examples and are intended to be used for communication to project stakeholders or replaced with executable computer code such as MATLAB or Python scripts, thereby making the model useful for simulation depending on the modeling tool selected.
	
	\subsection{Conceptual Architecture}\label{sec:architecture}
	The conceptual architecture of the wireless work-cell model is depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:conceptual:bdd}.  This serves to orient the reader during the presentation of detailed model decomposition in Section~\ref{sec:detailed-model}.  The work-cell model is composed of at least one Industrial Wireless Network (IWN) block and at least one Device block.  Applications are associated with Devices and performance constraints are applied to Applications. The Wireless Device is a subclass of Device, and the Controller is a further derivation of the wireless device. In this model, a Controller is an abstract specialization of a wireless device that represents all types of devices intended to control other processes.  Devices such as the Robot Controller and the PLC are special classes of Wireless Device containing all of the structure and behavior of the wireless device.  Finally, an often overlooked component of any industrial wireless deployment is the spectrum monitoring system represented by the SMS Agent. Blocks in the model communicate through ports such as the \textit{ant} port which represents the antenna or waveguide interface.  Composition is further implied by the parts, constraints, and parameters associated with each block. These are listed within the compartments of each block.

In this diagram, only the most generalized blocks necessary to construct a work-cell scenario are shown.  More application-specific scenarios may be developed by deriving new blocks from the constructs shown here. }%
		\label{fig:conceptual:bdd}
	\end{figure*}
	
	\section{Detailed Model Decomposition}\label{sec:detailed-model}
	\subsection{General Package}
	The General package contains the reusable elements of the model.  In particular, the General package contains elements that are not particular to any one work-cell component but can be reused or applied across several.  The concepts of time, clocks, and synchronization are included within General.  Moreover, several types of constraints are defined.  
	
	\subsubsection{Time}
	Time is an important construct within communication systems as well as industrial control systems.  Time is realized as a set of one or more clocks. A work-cell will contain one to several clocks typically embedded within each device to allow those devices to synchronize to a common clock. The local clocks within the work-cell devices will synchronize to a master reference clock and usually one with a high degree of precision, accuracy, and stability.  The degree to which the local clocks synchronize to the master will depend on the requirements of the applications that the local clocks serve.  Clock synchronization can be costly in power, size, and monetary cost of the devices, but it may be necessary depending on the applications using a clock.  Clock performance is a key driver of size and power consumption, and synchronization of clocks across a wireless network can be a challenge and is a highly studied field~\cite{ClockSync.Mahmood2017,ClockSync.Geetha2017}. Moreover, the Time package includes a constraint, Clock Performance, to represent the production of time and synchronization with a master clock. 
	
	\subsubsection{Constraints}\label{sec:general:constraints}
	Constraints provide limitations on the performance of an element within the model.  Within General, several constraints are defined which may be applied to any block within the model. These constraints include motion constraints, radio channel constraints, and networking constraints as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:constraints:motion}-\ref{fig:constraints:network}.  
	
	\paragraph{Motion Constraints}\label{sec:constraints:motion}
	
	\begin{figure}[tbp]
		\subfloat[Motion Constraints\label{fig:constraints:motion}]{%
			\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{diagrams/bdd__Motion_Constraints__Motion}}

		}  
		\caption{Generalized network constraints consisting of rigid body motion~\protect\subref{fig:constraints:motion}, the radio channel~\protect\subref{fig:constraints:radio} and the network services~\protect\subref{fig:constraints:network}.}
		\label{fig:general:constraints}      
	\end{figure}
	
	When applied, these constraints provide the bounds of dynamical performance.  For example, motion constraints determine the positions, velocities, and accelerations on a rigid body.  The force vector equations \eqref{eq:robot:dynamics} are the general governing dynamic laws of motion as forces on a vector of joints as exerted by the end-effector or set of end-effectors on the environment.  The equations constrain the robot to operate according to the laws of physics, where the joint-space inertia matrix, $H$, is an ${n}\times{n}$ symmetric, positive-definite matrix, and $q$, $\dot{q}$, and $\ddot{q}$ are vectors of position, velocity, and acceleration, respectively.  The variable $f_{ext}$ is the six degrees of freedom (DOF) force acting on the end-effector, and $c$ is the joint-space bias force required to produce a zero sum force on the end-effector~\cite{Featherstone2007}.  
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:robot:dynamics}
	\Gamma = H(q) \ddot{q} + c(q,\dot{q},f_{\!ext})
	\end{equation}    
 where $\Gamma$ is the vector of forces exerted by the end-effectors.  
    
	This system of equations is controlled using a combination of digital feed-forward and feedback compensation in which the communication mechanism of the robot states directly impacts the controller's effectiveness. Joint control via a wireless network connection is typically avoided; however, monitoring of the linear and angular forces represented by $f_{\!ext}$ as sensed by a 6-DOF force-torque (FT) wireless sensor can be advantageous for many industrial applications.  As such, the performance of the wireless connection between a FT sensor and the controller can be a limiting factor in the performance of force-sensitive applications. Such a constraint may be applied to robot manipulators as defined in Section~\ref{sec:robotics}.
	
	\paragraph{Radio Channel Constraint}\label{sec:constraints:radio}
	
	The radio channel constraint limits wireless information flow to the laws of propagation which includes path loss, reflection, diffraction, and interference.  By applying this constraint to Wireless Devices described in Section~\ref{sec:devices:wireless-device}, such devices experience the effects of a lossy communication medium. The radio channel when applied to a wireless communication link within the work-cell manifests itself in accordance of the illustration of Fig.~\ref{fig:par:iwn-radio}.  The parametric equations for the radio channel include path loss, multi-path, and interference.  Path loss is generically modeled as the input signal divided by the bulk power loss in the channel. Path loss is often characterized as a two-piece linear function of distance\cite{Candell2017.NIST1951}. Multi-path is modeled as convolution of the transmitted radio signal with a linear time-varying impulse response characterizing the electromagnetic propagation between transmitter and receiver antenna systems.  Interference is then modeled as an additive component with power, bandwidth, and probability of excitation.

		\caption{SysML parametric diagram of the radio channel constraints of the industrial wireless network.}%
		\label{fig:par:iwn-radio}
	\end{figure} 
	
	\paragraph{Data Constraints}\label{sec:constraints:data}
	
	\begin{figure}[tbp]
		\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{diagrams/par__Service__Service}%
		\caption{SysML parametric diagram of the data constraints applied to the industrial wireless network.}%
		\label{fig:par:iwn:data}
	\end{figure}    
	
	Delay, mutation, and loss of information within the industrial wireless network are encapsulated by the Network constraints block.  The Network constraint is applied to wireless devices within the network and represents the impacts of the radio channel and network components and protocols.  These constraints are illustrated in a parametric diagram of Fig.~\ref{fig:par:iwn:data} in which the rules for delay, mutation, and loss are applied to a service of an industrial wireless network within a work-cell. As with any constraint, the rules for data loss may be modeled as equations, psuedocode, or executable computer code such as MATLAB script or C.  These rules decide if information is lost due to delay or mutation.  While it is easy to understand how mutation leads to loss through a mechanism such as a checksum, unacceptable delay can also lead to loss of data.  
	
	% equations for data constraints
	Delay is simply a function of time, the physical environment of the factory work-cell, and state of the network at time, $t$. Many features of the network and the physical environment will have an impact on the output of the delay equation and will include data transmission duration, radio wave propagation delay, signal-to-noise, protocol for reliability, routing, internal queuing, and processing. A generalized equation for information delay by the wireless network is given as the sum of processing delay, queuing delay, transmission delay, and propagation delay. Subsequently, information loss is modeled as a set of rules governed by the attributes of the network infrastructure, transport medium, and protocols shown in~\eqref{eq:network-loss}. These rules may include thresholds for unacceptable delay and the ability of the network to correct for data mutation or loss in the physical channel (i.e. the air interface).
	
	\begin{equation}\label{eq:network-loss}
	\mathcal{Y}(t,\mathcal{X},\mathcal{N}) = 
	\begin{cases} 
	\mathcal{X} & \text{if } \mathcal{X} \vdash \mathcal{L}(t,\mathcal{X},\mathcal{N}) \\
	\emptyset   & \text{otherwise}
	\end{cases}
	\end{equation}
    where $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are blocks of data traversing the network and $\mathcal{N}$ is the state of the network at time, $t$.	We model the loss constraints as a general set of rules, $\mathcal{L}$, taking into account that each network system will have a different set of configuration attributes and protocols.  The rules will therefore change for each operational system and the networks used.  When the rules for loss are applied, the output of the network, $\mathcal{Y}$, becomes the input to the network, $\mathcal{X}$, when $\mathcal{X}$ satisfies $\mathcal{L}(t,\mathcal{X},\mathcal{N})$.

	\end{figure}
	
	Applications, commonly implemented as software and firmware, represent the intelligence of devices.  The application defines the behavior and the information flow requirements of the work-cell.  As defined in the model, without Applications implemented in software, firmware, or hardware, the work-cell devices would not function.  The definition of the Application block is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:application:bdd}.  The Application block is constrained by the Program constraint which defines the logic of the program, its expected data flow input rates, and its tolerances to delay and information loss.  Devices host multiple applications each with a unique set of constraint properties.  It is essential when constructing a work-cell model that each application is identified and modeled appropriately.  An example of an Application is a collision detection system within a robot controller. Table~\ref{tab:sample:constraints} illustrates sample parameters used in the collision detector Application.

	Specification of Application constraints provides a clear picture of the requirements of the factory automation system which can be projected on the wireless network. Through this process, it is possible to determine such requirements as scalability, throughput, reliability, and latency of the supporting network services modeled as radio and data constraints in Section~\ref{sec:general:constraints}. Indeed, as the manufacturing system becomes more complex and wireless becomes essential to communication, the projection of manufacturing requirements onto the wireless communication system becomes less clear.  Frequency planning, transmission scheduling, and error correction schemes become less obvious, and considerations of power, reliability, latency, and scale become optimization trade-offs. Such analyses are not within the scope of this paper but are important considerations for future research of manufacturing systems.  As such, the architectural elements and information flows exposed by an abstract model are a necessary first step.
	
	\subsection{Industrial Wireless Network}
	
	Central to the automation system is connectivity among devices and controllers.  More specifically, modern automation systems often employ networks to conduct inter-device communication.  The term \textit{inter-device} is appropriate as the Device block serves as the basis for all other components that communicate through the network.  Our model of the IWN is composed simply as a radio channel, a set of services, and a set of clocks as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:iwn:bdd}.  This simplification of the model is necessary to allow the users of the model to provide as much or as little detail of the implementations of the radio channel and underlying services as required for their implementations.

		\label{fig:iwn:ibd:full}
	\end{figure}
	
	Connectivity of a constructed IWN is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:iwn:ibd}.  An IWN is internally modeled such that information flows as radio frequency (RF) energy through the \textit{ant} port.  A radio channel is applied, theoretically for each pairwise link, and the modified signal is passed to the services for processing.  Network processing is modeled by the properties of network constraints as defined in Section~\ref{sec:constraints:data}.  Once processed by network services, information is routed back through the radio channel through the \textit{ant} port to other Devices connected to the IWN.  Moreover, the Service block includes a parametric model as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:iwn:ibd:full}. This IBD with exposed parametrics exemplifies the inclusion parameters such as information delay and loss caused by the IWN, but it also exemplifies the impact of protocols and infrastructure (throughput, memory, etc.) within the network.  These effects are modeled as rules of loss shown in~\eqref{eq:network-loss}.
	
	\subsection{Devices}\label{sec:devices}
    
    \subsubsection{Device}\label{sec:devices:device}
	
	A Device, defined in Fig.~\ref{fig:bdd:devices}, is generic construct representing an element within the work-cell with processing, memory, and storage capability. Devices have the capability to run applications as defined in Section~\ref{sec:application}.  Devices are sub-classed into Sensor and Actuator devices which generically refer to any type of sensor or actuator, and, in particular, the wired variety.  The Device is further sub-classed to the Wireless Device which is the central theme of our analysis.  Derived from the Wired Device are the Wireless Sensor and Wireless Actuator as well as the Controller.  The Controller represents the base class for deriving work-cell devices such as the PLC and the Robot Controller, sections~\ref{sec:plc} and~\ref{sec:robotics}, respectively, and provides support for external input-output (IO).

	\subsubsection{Wireless Devices}\label{sec:devices:wireless-device} 
	A Wireless Device is a subclass of Device that contains the various components necessary for untethered communication.  These devices then communicate with each other through one or more industrial wireless networks (IWNs) which contains antenna systems, transceivers, protocols, and network services.  The relationships and composition of the Wireless Device are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:wirelessdevice:full}. As shown, the wireless device is composed of at least one transceiver and each transceiver is composed of at least one antenna system which is composed of at least one antenna element.  The antenna system is constrained by its gain profile.

		\label{fig:testdevice:full}      
	\end{figure}
	
	The Test Device is a subclass of Device that represents devices used for calibration or ground truth testing of properties of a work-cell.  The block definition and internal configuration are illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:testdevice:full}.  A Test Device is constrained by its accuracy and precision as well as the algorithm for controlling measurement.  An example of a test device is a calibrated force sensor that may be used as comparison to a 6-DOF wireless sensor mounted on the wrist of a robot arm as shown in the top left of Fig.~\ref{fig:workcell:examples}. Test devices are useful and necessary elements of the wireless testbed to establish accurate and repeatable ground truth measurements.  For example, a stationary precision force sensor may be used to establish a ground truth force value, and a high-accuracy vision tracking system is used for truth in position.  Test devices are modeled such that measurements may traverse the operational wireless network or a stand-alone wired interface.
	
	\subsection{Robotics}\label{sec:robotics}
	\begin{figure}[tbp]

		\label{fig:robotocontroller:full}	
	\end{figure}
	
	The robotics package contains elements specific to robot systems.  Robot systems are composed of at least one robot controller associated with one or more robots, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:robotcontroller:bdd}.  In manufacturing, robots interact with their surrounding to accomplish assigned tasks such as tending machinery, moving materials, welding, and inspecting. Robot controllers provide support for external IO devices.  In addition, modern robot controllers will support a variety of open and proprietary network protocols allowing for interaction with other actors in the work-cell.  The robot controller's main task is control of the rigid body dynamics of the robots which is usually conducted via real-time communication over a high-throughput serial field-bus. While joint control is conducted using wires, the robot controller is responsible for other tasks requiring reliable, low-latency communication in which wireless may serve a role.  These tasks are captured in the model as applications (Fig.~\ref{fig:robotcontroller:ibd}) and explained as follows.
	
	\begin{description}
		
		\item[Robot States Publisher] Transmission of robot states to external actors such as other robot controllers, supervisors, and safety systems.
		
		\item[Arm Controller] Also known as manipulator control, serves to accept position commands as Cartesian or joint space trajectories and waypoints from other actors within the work-cell.
		
		\item[End Effector Control] Command and control of the robot end-effector such as a gripper or sensor.  The end-effector may be equipped with a high-throughput wireless sensor necessitating reliable communication.
		
		\item[Inverse Kinematics] Converts Cartesian coordinates of the end-effector into joint positions.
		
		\item[Path Planner] Determines the optimal geometrical trajectory to achieve a final pose given knowledge of self-collision and real-time knowledge of the surround environment.  Path planning is a sophisticated part of a robot system and may be allocated to an external system depending on throughput and latency requirements.
		
		\item[Collision Detector] This application monitors the states of other actors and obstructions within the work-cell. If possibility of collision is detected, the collision detector takes action.
		
	\end{description} 
	
	These applications within the robotic work-cell define many information flows requiring careful analysis to achieve reliability and latency necessary for the safety and control of the manufacturing process. Information flows are identified in Section~\ref{sec:wireless-infoflows}.
	
	\subsection{PLC}\label{sec:plc}
	The PLC is a specialized class of Controller.  PLCs were originally developed to mirror relay circuits in software; however, the modern PLC is much more advanced and is usually equipped with multiple processors, a real-time operating system (OS), and capabilities to support various types of industrial IO devices.  In addition, modern PLCs (also called automation servers) include both a general purpose OS with a real-time kernel and multiple network interfaces.  Many network-routable protocols are also supported.  With the addition of wireless protocols, PLCs now have the ability to support IO devices connected remotely without wires.  Supervision of untethered robots is also possible using PLCs.  The PLC is modeled as a Controller device with the work-cell model.  Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:PLC:ibd}, the PLC is modeled as a wireless device with transceiver, logic application, and safety applications.  More sophisticated PLCs may be modeled by extending the PLC block.  As applications, the logic and safety functions are constrained by application constraints. Finally, as Controller devices, PLCs are modeled with an IO port, thus IO can be connected to the PLC by wires or by wireless network connection.

	\subsection{Safety}\label{sec:safety}
% 	\textcolor{red}{MOHAMED TO WRITE}
% 	\textcolor{blue}{Allocation of safety features from the PLC. High availability IO input devices, output relays, used for E-STOP usually to protect life and property; constrained by response time requirement of the safety rating}
    
    In a work-cell with interacting humans and robots, functional safety requirements are typically strict by specifying the rules related to four main safety criteria, namely, monitored stops, controlled speeds, separation distances, and power and force limits in order to prevent injury for humans and damage for equipment. The wireless safety package is composed of a safety controller and safety devices. Traditionally, the safety requirements of the work-cell is fixed and managed by the safety controller which receives safety-related measurements and takes the corresponding actions. Alternatively, the safety controller may be connected to the PLC where the current work-cell activities are supervised.  The PLC will determine the required safety rating and the safety controller behaves accordingly. The dedicated safety controller is needed to achieve the required high reliability and low latency safety requirements and it can be a general PLC with safety modules. 
    
    The safety devices include non-safety-rated devices such as the various work-cell sensors and actuators and safety-rated input and output devices. Safety control input devices include Emergency-stop and enabling buttons while output devices include relays and switches for various work-cell equipment. The use of wireless in safety control loops allows installing a larger number of sensing devices including vision systems to monitor the human and robots activities, velocity and proximity sensors, and machine status sensors. Moreover, wireless allows to have mobile control panels where workers can activate a safety device at any time and location within the work-cell.        
	
	\subsection{Vision}\label{sec:vision}

% 	\textcolor{blue}{composition (vision processing, optical devices with networking interfaces, general panning and zooming, object detection, interface to robotic system, interface to the supervisory system)}
    
%     \textcolor{green}{Make that we allow the following in your definition: part tracking, object detection, intput to collision avoidance systems, tracking of mobile robots, augmented reality devices/systems, security cameras, etc.}
    The vision system considered in this subsection is the one used for work-cell monitoring and general object detection. It does not cover the machine-embedded vision systems which can be used for inspection and characterization of objects such as the shape, color, texture, or size of processed materials. The data collected by the work-cell vision system can be used for parts and mobile robots tracking, collision avoidance, object detection, security identification systems, and augmented reality devices and systems. The vision system communicates with the supervisory control, robotic controller, and the safety system to provide the work-cell state which contains the positions of various equipment, robots, and humans. 
    
   The vision system is composed of optical devices, vision processing unit, and interfaces to various work-cell systems. The optical devices are the cameras for capturing images at high enough speed to track and detect various objects. These cameras have wireless network interfaces to be connected to the vision processing unit to allow collaborative processing of the captured images and obtaining precise work-cell state. The vision processing unit performs data acquisition from the distributed optical devices and feature extraction to detect and track the positions of various entities in the work-cell. 
   
   The vision system communicates the corresponding data to the supervisory control, robotic control, and the safety system for decision making based on the captured work-cell state. The supervisory controller uses vision system data for robots and workers localization, parts detection and identification, and schedules tasks using this information. The robotics controller uses these data for motion control, path planning, and collision detection. Finally, the safety controller uses these data for safety requirements implementation such as enforcing safety stops, controlling the speeds of moving objects, and limiting power and forces of various work-cell components.    
	
	\subsection{Spectrum Monitoring System}\label{sec:sms}
	A spectrum monitoring system (SMS) is an often overlooked yet valuable part of the wireless factory work-cell with requirements specified in~\cite{Candell2017.SMS}.  The SMS is modeled as an atomic agent within the work-cell.  The SMS Agent is one component in a larger enterprise-level spectrum monitoring deployment.  The SMS agent shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sms:bdd} includes a transceiver, an event detector, and a reporting agent.  The transceiver can be implemented as an RF-to-baseband down-converter.  The detector application is responsible for detection and estimation of anomalous spectral events and may employ machine learning to accurately detect anomalies and report localized spectral events.
	
	The reporter application collects, filters, and reports event information to a central management console.  SMS reports support identification of long-term patterns such as growth trends in particular wireless bands.  Since the SMS Agent is part of a larger network of spectrum monitoring, it is presumed that reports are wirelessly transmitted back to the enterprise management console.  These reporting events use bandwidth otherwise used for the factory operation, thus reports must be made concise and infrequent.  This implies substantial filtering and intelligence in the local SMS agents This may provide opportunities for research.
	
	Detection events may be routed to the local supervisor, robot controller, and safety system.  By leveraging spectral awareness, work-cells can be made safer and more reliable.  As SMS are not yet widespread in industrial applications; thus, standardized protocols are needed for reporting and integration with automation systems.

        Humans can exist in a modern work-cell for short or long periods of time depending on the required task. Two categories of human-related aspects are captured in the work-cell model. First, the human existence in the work-cell leads to detection and identification of the corresponding worker for both safety and security. Also, human motion within the work-cell requires position tracking for environment monitoring and spectrum monitoring due to radio frequency channel variations with human movements. The second category includes the human interfaces with the work-cell process that include portable control devices, wearable sensors, and workers communication devices to get task commands. Moreover, depending on the process constraint, personal devices of workers may interfere with the work-cell communications if allowed.      
	
	\section{Significant Wireless Information Flows}\label{sec:wireless-infoflows}
	% Rick's section	
	\begin{figure*}[tbp]
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{diagrams/ibd__Combined_PP_with_FT_Limiting__Combined_PP_with_FT_Limiting}
		\caption{IBD of a work-cell employing multiple networks in collaborative robot operation coexisting with robot force limiting inspection station.}
		\label{fig:workcell:examples}     
	\end{figure*}
	
	The number and type of wireless information flows will depend on the configuration of the work, the number of applications, and the places where wireless is applied. Two types of work-cells, a force-torque limiter robotic application and a two-robot collaborative pick and place operation are depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:workcell:examples}.
	
	The force limiter section is composed of a robot controller, a robot, and an FT sensor. A PLC is used for work-cell supervision, and a test device is deployed for ground truth measurement.  An SMS agent monitors the electromagnetic spectrum.  A Radio Emitter is included to model the transmission of interference.  An IEEE 802.11n network is represented in the model by an IWN block. Properties of the radio channel and services of the communication system are therefore represented. Similarly, the pick-and-place example is composed of two robots, a PLC, an IWN, and an SMS Agent in addition to proximity sensors and an IEEE 802.11ax network.
	
	Referring to these examples, typical information flows are easily identified as connections between Wireless Device blocks and the antenna port, \textit{ant}, of the IWN.  Recall that the IWN includes radio channel and services offered by the network itself.  Therefore, all wireless information flows will traverse the IWN through the \textit{ant} port.  Applications are implied and produce and consume the information according to associated constraint properties.  Information flows are generated by the interactions between actors and include the following:  
	
	\begin{description}
		
		\item[Robot States] The geometry states of the robot such as position, velocity, and acceleration of each joint or end-effector. Robot states may include Cartesian or joint space readings depending on the need of other applications or the capabilities of publisher.  Robot states are usually transmitted at 30 Hz or faster~\cite{JMarvel2017}.
		
		\item[Force Sensor Readings] The readings from a sensor mounted on the wrist of each robot arm. These readings are typically in the format of wrenches (linear and angular forces) and are transmitted at rates from 15 Hz for monitoring applications up to 500 Hz for force limiting and control applications~\cite{onrobot}. Other sensors may produce data in the system such as proximity sensors which can generate data in the range of 1-50 Hz~\cite{DiffuseSensorSpecs} and Tactile sensors which can have information flow rates faster than 1000 Hz~\cite{TactileInternet}.
        
        \item[Machine Health Monitoring] Readings from sensors mounted within machinery such as mills, routers, and lathes used to sense and predict deviations of mechanical components from design tolerances. Readings for prognostics and health monitoring are often aggregated at the source with statistical metrics being communicated to a factory enterprise application; however, non-aggregated readings may also be transmitted to a remote signal analyzer.  Health monitoring sensors measure temperature, vibration, acceleration, inclination, position, and rates of change of angles. Information flows from a single aggregation point may reach 200 kB/s on average for a 6-DOF sensor apparatus described in~\cite{ELWeiss}. While the outputs of health monitoring sensors are usually wired into a local aggregation devices, it is desirable to transmit these readings to an on-line optimizer or PLC within the work-cell~\cite{Weiss2016.PHM}.
 
		\item[IO States and Supervisory Messages] These contain both the boolean-valued readings and commands from sensors, and task orders in the form of short commands and lists of instructions which can originate from any supervisor within the network such as a PLC or other controller. Sensor readings (inputs) and actuation commands (outputs) are transmitted in periodically or pseudo-randomly at rates indicative of movements of machinery and materials through the manufacturing process.  Typical analog and boolean IO states range from to 10 Hz to 100 Hz depending on the manufacturing process~\cite{TwinCAT}.
% 		\item[Supervisory Messages] Directives and task orders in the form of short commands and lists of instructions and can originate from any supervisor within the network such as a PLC or other controller. Supervisory messages include state information such as task status from collaborating actors within the work-cell. 
		
		\item[SMS Events] The SMS agent will communicate state information and directives to controllers within the work-cell.  These messages allow the automation system to react under anomalous spectrum conditions within the work-cell. These information flows may be necessary for safe operation of the work-cell. The data rate of reports from an SMS agent without processing or compression can be in the range of 1 to 10 megabits per second (Mbps)~\cite{cuevas_2015}.
        
        \item[Vision Applications] The vision system will communicate videos or images for processing and decision making. Typical Video flows can have the rates of 30 Hz for surveillance and 125 Hz for motion capturing~\cite{industrialCCTV, ELWeiss}. Information flow for Object tracking systems can have the rate of 10-200 Hz depending on the tracked objects and the required accuracy~\cite{lidar, motioncapture}. 
  	\end{description}
	%\vspace{5mm}

In this section, examples have been presented to illustrate the use of the proposed work-cell model. In these examples, data update rate as a characteristic of information flow in the model is specified for each of the components. The model uses information flow characteristics to represent the IWN properties and services for the corresponding example.

	\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
	A model was developed using SysML.  The developed model is constructed of the elements necessary to construct useful representations of factory work-cells in which wireless networks are used to transport information necessary for automated control system operation.  Reusable, derivable elements are developed and then extended to represent the constructs of the work-cell such as robot control, supervisory control, vision, safety, and spectrum monitoring.  An industrial wireless network is then developed and constraints of the radio channel and network services are formalized. Using the architectural model, information flows are explored and incorporated within. Our model in its current state of development is comprehensive enough to support architectural and ontological analyses of the factory work-cell.  As such, information about the relationships between components of a work-cell and attributes related to the wireless network may be discovered.  Therefore, our model serves as a foundation for future systems engineering analyses. Moreover, our model may be used as a tool for academic and industry exploration of wireless testbed development.  We make the model openly available through GitHub at~\cite{SysML.Candell2018}.
