%\section{Future Work}
%Application of Machine Learning within the workcell control program
%
%how to extended the graph database and other data management approaches to the the factory and factory workcell rather than just for performance appraisal in the lab.
%
%Improvements to the schema, queries, and other database improvements to overcome the challenges encountered during research.  For example, rapidly expanding cartesian products within queries.  I note that the selected database has inherent problems with large scale queries wherein a query is constructed to for efficiency yet the database ignores the rules of the query and forms a cartesian product regardless.
