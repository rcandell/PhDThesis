This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

The timing scheme was implemented using standard PCs and an 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless network. The control scheme was scaled up to a multimode multiplant arrangement with coordination among loops. To examine the wireless control loop performance, we use the rotating base variation of the linear inverted pendulum. Using the wireless control loop, we can examine a number of the characteristics of UDP data transmission over 802.11b.},

Inverted peduulum example could be a good testbed subject.

Asserts that low SNR makes root cause of packet loos difficult to resolve, i.e. noise versus delay loss (hard timing requirements)

Questions:
1/ For event-based control with many variables, how to determine most important meas and manip variables.

2/ How is physical peformance impacted by network timing scheme chosen?

3/ How does TC-20 working group apply to the IP problem?

4/ How does RF coexistence effect network performance, timing, and plant performance?

5/ How does RF propagation and interference impact performance?

6/ How does wireless security or attack impact performance? Can we design a system that is resilient to attack using teh inv. pend. problem?

7/ How does the timing and control approach presented here scale to larger systems?},

While CCA itself is implemented at the PHY layer, the primary impact of its performance/complexity is on MAC metrics like throughput and energy efficiency; this cross-layer dependency makes it necessary to enhance MAC protocol performance evaluation by considering the specifics of CCA implementation that are naturally link-dependant. We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

abstract = { In wireless communications, the relative strength of the direct and scattered components of the received signal, as expressed by the Ricean K factor, provides an indication of link quality. Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

Radio channels in radio systems are usually characterized as multipath fading channels. In environment between transmitter and receiver there exist two main signal propagation components, Line-of-Sight (LOS) and Non-Line-of-Sight (NLOS), which are described through Rician fading model, resp. Rayleigh fading model. The parameter which is widely used for channel classification is the channel impulse response.},

abstract = {Wide-band multipath measurements at 1300 MHz have been made in five factory buildings in Indiana. Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

abstract = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

In this paper, the main methodologies suggested in the literature to cope with typical network-induced constraints, namely time delays, packet losses and disorder, time-varying transmission intervals, competition of multiple nodes accessing networks, and data quantization are surveyed; the constraints suggested in the literature on the first two types of constraints are updated in different categorizing ways; and those on the latter three types of constraints are extended.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

abstract="The {IEEE} 802.15.4a standard provides a framework for low-data-rate communication systems, typically sensor networks. In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.",

abstract="We evaluate the performance of realistic wireless sensor networks in indoor scenarios. Most of the considered networks are formed by nodes using the Zigbee communication protocol. For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.",

abstract="The successful introduction of flexible, reconfigurable and self-adaptive manufacturing processes relies upon evolving traditional automation ISA-95 automation solutions to adopt innovative automation pyramids. These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.",

abstract="In this paper, a decomposition method for evaluating the performance of continuous flow lines with machines characterized by general Markovian fluid models and finite capacity buffers is proposed. This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.",

abstract={Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

abstract = {Systems engineers must understand how all the parts of a digital system work together, including hardware AND software. SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In many radio propagation environments, a line of sight (LoS) component exists between the transmitter and the receiver. This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

The timing scheme was implemented using standard PCs and an 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless network. The control scheme was scaled up to a multimode multiplant arrangement with coordination among loops. To examine the wireless control loop performance, we use the rotating base variation of the linear inverted pendulum. Using the wireless control loop, we can examine a number of the characteristics of UDP data transmission over 802.11b.},

Inverted peduulum example could be a good testbed subject.

Asserts that low SNR makes root cause of packet loos difficult to resolve, i.e. noise versus delay loss (hard timing requirements)

Questions:
1/ For event-based control with many variables, how to determine most important meas and manip variables.

2/ How is physical peformance impacted by network timing scheme chosen?

3/ How does TC-20 working group apply to the IP problem?

4/ How does RF coexistence effect network performance, timing, and plant performance?

5/ How does RF propagation and interference impact performance?

6/ How does wireless security or attack impact performance? Can we design a system that is resilient to attack using teh inv. pend. problem?

7/ How does the timing and control approach presented here scale to larger systems?},

While CCA itself is implemented at the PHY layer, the primary impact of its performance/complexity is on MAC metrics like throughput and energy efficiency; this cross-layer dependency makes it necessary to enhance MAC protocol performance evaluation by considering the specifics of CCA implementation that are naturally link-dependant. We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

abstract = { In wireless communications, the relative strength of the direct and scattered components of the received signal, as expressed by the Ricean K factor, provides an indication of link quality. Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

@article{Rappaport1989,
abstract = {Wide-band multipath measurements at 1300 MHz have been made in five factory buildings in Indiana. Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

abstract = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

In addition, performance analysis with respect to the three features of WIA-PA has been conducted in terms of communication overhead or transmission reliability. Our results demonstrate the performance advantages of WIA-PA over WirelessHART and ISA 100.11a.",

abstract="The {IEEE} 802.15.4a standard provides a framework for low-data-rate communication systems, typically sensor networks. In this paper, we established a realistic environment for the time delay characteristic of industrial network based on IEEE 802.15.4a. Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes. The results show that IEEE 802.15.4a is suitable for some industrial applications that have more relaxed throughput requirements and time-delay. Some issues that could degrade the network performance are also discussed.",

abstract="We evaluate the performance of realistic wireless sensor networks in indoor scenarios. Most of the considered networks are formed by nodes using the Zigbee communication protocol. For comparison, we also analyze networks based on the proprietary standard Z-Wave. Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios. Then, the network behavior is characterized in terms of end-to-end delay and throughput. In order to confirm the experiments, analytical and simulation results are also derived.",

abstract="The successful introduction of flexible, reconfigurable and self-adaptive manufacturing processes relies upon evolving traditional automation ISA-95 automation solutions to adopt innovative automation pyramids. These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.",

abstract="In this paper, a decomposition method for evaluating the performance of continuous flow lines with machines characterized by general Markovian fluid models and finite capacity buffers is proposed. This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.",

abstract={Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.

economy towards a global and competitive economy, with markets demanding for highly customized products of 

high quality at lower costs, and with short life cycles. In this environment, manufacturing enterprises, to 

remain competitive, must respond closely to customer demands by improving their flexibility and agility, while 

maintaining their productivity and quality. Dynamic response to emergence is becoming a key issue in 

manufacturing field because traditional manufacturing control systems are built upon rigid control 

architectures, which cannot respond efficiently and effectively to dynamic change. In these circumstances, the 

current challenge is to develop manufacturing control systems that exhibit intelligence, robustness and 

adaptation to the environment changes and disturbances. The introduction of multi-agent systems and holonic 

manufacturing systems paradigms addresses these requirements, bringing the advantages of modularity, 

decentralization, autonomy, scalability and re-usability. This paper surveys the literature in manufacturing 

control systems using distributed artificial intelligence techniques, namely multi-agent systems and holonic 

manufacturing systems principles. The paper also discusses the reasons for the weak adoption of these 

approaches by industry and points out the challenges and research opportunities for the future."

abstract = {In many radio propagation environments, a line of sight (LoS) component exists between the transmitter and the receiver. This way the time-varying envelope of the received signal can be described by a Rician distribution with Rician factor K. Therefore, precise and efficient methods of Rician K factor estimation are of substantial concern. In this paper we examine a Rician K factor estimator suitable for wireless communication systems. The estimator is based on the envelope of the unmodulated received signal and an expression between the Rician channel statistics and K factor is presented. We depict its functionality for fixed and low mobility systems, with different carrier frequencies, thus making the estimator candidate for use not only for specific systems such as mobile communications. In the examined cases of mobility and carrier usage, the estimator achieves very satisfactory results for low signal to noise ratio (SNR) values and K factor values.},

@article{Ploplys2004,
abstract = { This article includes an implementation of an 802.11b wireless control loop with high communication rates and a timing scheme that uses clock driven sensing and actuation with event-driven control. The timing scheme was implemented using standard PCs and an 802.11b peer-to-peer wireless network. The control scheme was scaled up to a multimode multiplant arrangement with coordination among loops. To examine the wireless control loop performance, we use the rotating base variation of the linear inverted pendulum. Using the wireless control loop, we can examine a number of the characteristics of UDP data transmission over 802.11b.},
annote = {Provides overview of wirelss control research up until 2004.

Older paper but still relevant. (Must look into TW-20 of 802.11)

Provides an LQ contrroller design for an inverted penduulum.

Focus on timing schemes for real-time control.

Inverted peduulum example could be a good testbed subject.

Asserts that low SNR makes root cause of packet loos difficult to resolve, i.e. noise versus delay loss (hard timing requirements)

Questions:
1/ For event-based control with many variables, how to determine most important meas and manip variables.

2/ How is physical peformance impacted by network timing scheme chosen?

3/ How does TC-20 working group apply to the IP problem?

4/ How does RF coexistence effect network performance, timing, and plant performance?

5/ How does RF propagation and interference impact performance?

6/ How does wireless security or attack impact performance? Can we design a system that is resilient to attack using teh inv. pend. problem?

7/ How does the timing and control approach presented here scale to larger systems?},

abstract = {Clear channel assessment (CCA) is an essential ingredient in wireless networks employing channel sensing as part of their medium access mechanism. While CCA itself is implemented at the PHY layer, the primary impact of its performance/complexity is on MAC metrics like throughput and energy efficiency; this cross-layer dependency makes it necessary to enhance MAC protocol performance evaluation by considering the specifics of CCA implementation that are naturally link-dependant. We perform such a cross-layer evaluation of the impact of CCA on MAC performance for the specific case of IEEE 802.15.4 standard for WPANs and derive some heuristics to choose the type of CCA and its parameters based on traffic and channel conditions to realize improved MAC performance.},

@article{Tepedelenlio??lu2003,
abstract = { In wireless communications, the relative strength of the direct and scattered components of the received signal, as expressed by the Ricean K factor, provides an indication of link quality. Accordingly, efficient and accurate methods for estimating K are of considerable interest. In this paper, we propose a general class of moment-based estimators which use the signal envelope. This class of estimators unifies many of the previous estimators, and introduces new ones. We derive, for the first time, the asymptotic variance (AsV) of these estimators and compare them with the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB). We then tackle the problem of estimating K from the in-phase and quadrature-phase (I/Q) components of the received signal and illustrate the improvement in performance as compared with the envelope-based estimators. We derive the CRBs for the I/Q data model, which, unlike the envelope CRB, is tractable for correlated samples. Furthermore, we introduce a novel estimator that relies on the I/Q components, and derive its AsV even when the channel samples are correlated. We corroborate our analytical findings by simulations.},

@article{Rappaport1989,
abstract = {Wide-band multipath measurements at 1300 MHz have been made in five factory buildings in Indiana. Root mean square (rms) delay spread (U) values were found to range between 30 and 300 ns. Median U values were 96 ns for line-of-sight (LOS) paths along aisleways and 105 ns for obstructed paths across aisles. Worst case U of 300 ns was measured in a modern open plan metal-working factory. Delay spreads were not correlated with transmitter-receiver (T-R) separation or factory topogra- phy, but were affected by factory inventory, building construction materials, and wall locations. Wide band path loss measurements consistently agreed with continuous wave (CW) measurements made at identical locations. It is shown here that such empirical data suggest independent and identical uniform distributions on the phases of resolvable multipath signal components. Average factory path loss was found to be a function of distance to the 2.2 power. Wide-band factory propagation measurements have not been previously reported in the literature. I.},

abstract = {The pervasive application of wireless communications is well known. One such application is to an indoor factory environment. This environment creates challenges for reliable communications. One potential communication system that could be used to provide wireless communication in this environment is a Zigbee radio. Zigbee radios use about 2MHz of bandwidth in the 2.4GHz ISM band. To understand the performance of a Zigbee radio (or any other radio) in this environment the first task is to understand the propagation effects of such an environment. NIST has carried out a measurement campaign at various factory environments, including their own machine shop. We have used these measurements to develop channel models that are suitable for evaluating the performance of a Zigbee radio or any radios with bandwidth up to about 20MHz such as a WiFi based system. This report documents the results of processing the measurements to obtain channel models. Typical results for measurements made in the NIST machine shop for a 2.4GHz frequency are shown in the body of this document. Results for other frequencies and at other locations are shown in the appendicies.},

In this paper, the main methodologies suggested in the literature to cope with typical network-induced constraints, namely time delays, packet losses and disorder, time-varying transmission intervals, competition of multiple nodes accessing networks, and data quantization are surveyed; the constraints suggested in the literature on the first two types of constraints are updated in different categorizing ways; and those on the latter three types of constraints are extended.},

Our previous effort with C2 Wind Tunnel (C2WT) [2] [3] attempted to solve the challenges of evaluating these complex systems as-a-whole, by integrating multiple simulation platforms with varying semantics and integrating and managing different simulation models and their interactions. Recently, a great interest has developed to use Functional Mockup Interface (FMI) [4] for a variety of dynamics simulation packages, particularly in the automotive industry. Leveraging the C2WT effort on effective integration of different simulation engines with different Models of Computation (MoCs), we propose, in this paper, to use the proven methods of High-Level Architecture (HLA)-based model and system integration. We identify the challenges of integrating Functional Mockup Unit for Co-Simulation (FMU-CS) in general and via HLA [5] and present a novel model-based approach to rapidly synthesize an effective integration. The approach presented provides a unique opportunity to integrate readily available FMU-CS components with various specialized simulation packages to rapidly synthesize HLA-based integrated simulations for the overall composed Cyber-Physical Systems.},

Industrial wireless networked control system has been widely used, and how to evaluate the performance of the wireless network is of great significance. In this paper, considering the shortcoming of the existing performance evaluation methods, a comprehensive performance evaluation method of networks multi-indexes fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (MFAHP) combined with the fuzzy mathematics and the traditional analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is presented. The method can overcome that the performance evaluation is not comprehensive and subjective. Experiments show that the method can reflect the network performance of real condition. It has direct guiding role on protocol selection, network cabling, and node setting, and can meet the requirements of different occasions by modifying the underlying parameters.

Several sets of practical experiments are conducted to study its various features, including the effects of 1) numeral wireless nodes, 2) numeral data packets, 3) data transmissions with different upper-layer protocols, 4) physical distance between nodes, and 5) adding and reducing the number of the wireless nodes.

Two main groups of network scenarios are proposed: (i) scenarios with direct transmissions between the remote nodes and the network coordinator, and (ii) scenarios with routers, which relay the packets between the remote nodes and the coordinator. The sensor networks of interest are evaluated considering different performance metrics. In particular, we show how the received signal strength indication (RSSI) behaves in the considered scenarios.

abstract="The successful introduction of flexible, reconfigurable and self-adaptive manufacturing processes relies upon evolving traditional automation ISA-95 automation solutions to adopt innovative automation pyramids. These new approaches target the integration of data-intensive cloud and fog-based edge computing and communication digital manufacturing processes from the shop-floor to the factory to the cloud. The integration and operation of the required ICT, automation and robotic technologies and platforms is particularly challenging for manufacturing SMEs, which account for more than 80{\%} of manufacturing companies in Europe. This paper presents an insight into the business and operational processes, which motivate the development of a digital cognitive automation framework for collaborative robotics and modular manufacturing systems particularly tailored to SME operations and needs; i.e. the AUTOWARE Operative System. To meet the requirements of both large and small firms this paper elaborates on the smart integration of well-established SME friendly digital frameworks such as the ROS supported robotic Reconcell framework, the FIWARE-enabled BEinCPPS Cyber Physical Production framework and the OpenFog compliant TAPPS hardware framework.",

abstract="In this paper, a decomposition method for evaluating the performance of continuous flow lines with machines characterized by general Markovian fluid models and finite capacity buffers is proposed. This study uses the exact solution of general two-stage Markovian fluid models as a building block. Decomposition equations are provided to propagate the effect of partial and complete blocking and starvation phenomena throughout the system. A decomposition algorithm that solves the new decomposition equations is proposed. Numerical results prove the good accuracy of the developed method. In particular, a comparison with existing techniques shows that our method is generally more accurate, especially in the estimation of the average buffer levels. Moreover, additional information can be collected by the application of our approach which enables a deeper analysis of the system behavior. Finally, the generality of the approach allows for modeling and studying many different system configurations within a unique framework, also including several previously uninvestigated layouts.",

abstract={Downtime is arguably the single most significant contributor to system inefficiency in a multistage manufacturing system. Achieving near-zero downtime has been the ultimate goal of production operation management at the plant floor. Accurate estimation of the impact of each downtime incident is of great importance for deciding where to allocate limited resources among various manufacturing stages. In this paper, we focus on quantitative analysis of the impact of each individual downtime event in terms of permanent production loss and financial cost. We start from the transient analysis of a single downtime event and later extend to more generic scenarios where downtime incidents occur concurrently at different stages. Apart from the analytical study, a practical computation procedure using real-time production records can be readily derived and implemented at the plant floor. Case studies are conducted to demonstrate its potential in facilitating the decision making at plant floor on project identification, prioritization, and budget allocation in a multistage manufacturing system.},

abstract = {Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} is a free, open source ontology editor and a knowledge management system. Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} provides a graphic user interface to define ontologies. It also includes deductive classifiers to validate that models are consistent and to infer new information based on the analysis of an ontology. Like Eclipse, Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} is a framework for which various other projects suggest plugins. This application is written in Java and heavily uses Swing to create the user interface. Prot{\'{e}}g{\'{e}} recently has over 300,000 registered users. According to a 2009 book it is "the leading ontological engineering tool".},

@book{Friedenthal2015.SysML,
abstract = {Systems engineers must understand how all the parts of a digital system work together, including hardware AND software. SysML is the first design language to cover both hardware and software, allowing engineers to consider how all the parts of a system will successfully interact, from the very beginning of a project. This can prevent huge problems and delays down the line. Therefore, SysML use is becoming a widespread phenomenon, and many companies, especially in the defense, automotive, aerospace, medical device and telecommunications industries, are already using SysML, or are planning to switch over in the near future. Until now, little consolidated information has been available on the market regarding SysML. However, this book changes all that! It provides the hundreds of thousands of new users with a comprehensive guide to SysML, including a full description of the language itself, detailed instructions on how to implement it, exercises to help readers gain practical experience working with SysML, and extensive, real-world examples of actual successful projects, demonstrating all the benefits SysML can provide. *The authoritative guide for understanding and applying SysML * Authored by the foremost experts on the language *Language description, examples, and quick reference guide included. ?? 2008 Elsevier Inc.
