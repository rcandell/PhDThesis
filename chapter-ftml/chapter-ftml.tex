\chapterintro*
Wireless communications plays an essential role in the vision of future cyber-physical systems (CPS) which includes having more sensors and actuators, and, hence, more information transferred wirelessly. Many system and environmental features of industrial CPS affect the success of wireless communications on the factory floor. In this chapter, the author considers a representative industrial CPS use case of a robot arm control system equipped with a force-torque sensor. Movement of the arm is controlled by a robot controller applying a downward pressure on a spring assembly until a predetermined force is detected. This movement of the robot arm is tracked by a vision-based ground truth measurement system. This remote observer provides readings about the position of the robot arm where these readings are used to estimate the signal-to-interference ratio of the wireless link. By using readings from the remote observer, an estimation system is developed using machine learning regression techniques.  This work demonstrates the practicality of combining statistical analysis with machine learning to indirectly estimate signal-to-interference of the wireless communication link using measurements from the remote observer.  Results from the statistical analysis and the performance of the machine learning system are presented.  A supervised machine learning (ML) approach is used for the wireless channel quality estimation. the impact of selected system features on the estimation performance of various ML algorithms and compare their performance is studied.  Moreover, the author investigates the impact of the training and the estimation period on the performance of the proposed approach. The results provide insights about the impact of wireless communications on cyber-physical systems and an example of employing machine learning to improve industrial wireless deployments. 


	
	\section{Introduction} \label{ftml:sec:intro}    
	Industrial wireless systems (IWSs) are being deployed in various industrial environments due to the advances of wireless protocols and devices for cyber-physical systems (CPSs). Application domains for IWSs include flexible manufacturing, safety, process control, alerting and monitoring\cite{Candell2018.IWSGuide}. The advantages of deploying wireless communications in industrial applications due to the absence of cabling include ease of scale, flexibility, and lower cost compared the wired counterpart. Nevertheless, there are challenges in wireless deployments~\cite{Sisinni2018,Bello2017,Pang2017.WirelessChallenges}. The main cause of these challenges is the unpredictable and random nature of wireless channels. Challenges include latency uncertainty, error uncertainty, and  increased information loss when operating in the presence of significant interference and limited spectral resources~\cite{Candell2017.SAS.IWSWorkshopReport}. In addition, the quality of wireless data communications is impacted by various wireless channel impairments such as path loss, fading, multi-path, and interference. As a result, a careful design of wireless communications and control networks is required to deal with these impairments~\cite{Lu2016.WirelessCPS,Kim2017.WirelessCodesign}.    
    
    One of the major challenges in designing IWSs and the underlying industrial systems is interference detection and mitigation. Interference can result from various narrow-band or wide-band sources including  coexisting wireless systems, intentional jamming sources, and non-communications intended devices such as industrial equipment and microwave ovens~\cite{Chiwewe2015.Survey.CR.Intf}. Interference can degrade the communication quality of service (QoS) significantly and hence IWS designers consider various interference management techniques. 
    
    First, in this work, the author presents a method using random forest regression to estimate the SIR ratio of the communication channel within a robotic arm force-seeking scenario in which the force signal is transmitted over a wireless local area network (WLAN)~\cite{IEEE802.11ac}.  Position data from a vision-based tracking system, a distant observer, is used to train a channel quality estimator to infer the SIR of the wireless channel. The experiment is designed so that the small perturbations in the wireless channel resulting from interference will present position uncertainty in the physical system.  Next, the same testbed setup is deployed to explore, in more detail, the impact of machine learning on the performance of the detection algorithm.  It is also endeavored to understand the impact of various features in the training data set. Hence, position data is used from a vision-based tracking system, a distant observer, to train a channel quality estimator to infer the SIR experienced by both the wireless access point and the wireless station used within the experiment. Five different features are extracted from the position data captured by the vision system. 
    
    The contributions of this chapter are summarized as follows:
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The work explains in detail the proposed algorithm for SIR estimation, the testbed setup, and the features extracted from the position data.  Results of the algorithm are presented demonstrating the effectiveness of the machine learning algorithm.
        \item Various machine learning regression schemes are compared for SIR estimation, thereby demonstrating the superior performance of various ensemble-based approaches.
        \item Impact of individual features are studied regarding the performance of the proposed algorithm to understand the correlation between the interference level to each of these features. Hence, the correlation between physical systems behavior and the underlying quality of the wireless communications channel is better understood. 
        \item Finally, an analysis on the impacts of measurement interval and the training set size on the performance of the ML algorithms is provided.
    \end{itemize}
    
%\section{Related Work}    
%In the literature, two types of interference signals are considered, namely, intentional or unintentional interference. Methods to estimate, avoid, or mitigate interference are required for the deployment of reliable and deterministic IWSs. Machine learning has been widely used to detect and estimate interference information to enhance the performance of interference managment algorithms.  
% 
% The interference analysis in cyber-physical systems (CPSs) has been considered in multiple works for various scenarios. In~\cite{8639006}, in-network interference mitigation techniques are discussed for ultra reliable low-latency wireless communications systems. The paper focused on mutual interference mitigation in an industrial automation setting, where multiple transmissions from controllers to actuators interfere with each other. In \cite{Kumar2019}, an interference mitigating receiver architecture is proposed. The application scenarios are smart homes and modern factories where dense wireless communications devices exist. Moreover, in~\cite{Bhushan2014.NetworkDesensUsingIntfCancellation}, interference cancellation of transmissions from neighboring cells in a 5G cellular network is presented. In~\cite{Gomes2017.LQEinWSNs}, a method using a dedicated node for link quality estimation (LQE)  obtained through received data packets to identify interference and multi-path without introducing additional traffic is presented. In~\cite{Baccour2012.SurveyOnLinkEstimation}, a taxonomy of channel link quality techniques is presented providing a valuable survey on LQE algorithms and asserting the importance of link quality estimation in IWSs. In~\cite{Frounhoffer.Troubleshooting}, failure analysis and wireless network troubleshooting are performed whenever the CPS is not functioning properly. Interference analysis is one major part of the troubleshooting procedure which is performed through traffic patterns and wireless spectrum analysis. Also, in~\cite{NIST.InterfCoexCritical}, the use of spectrum analysis for interference detection and estimation is proposed for IWSs. 
% 
%On the other hand, intended interference (i.e., jamming) can lead to service denial or poor performance in wireless networks. In~\cite{8631535}, a literature review was presented which includes an overview of recent research efforts on networked control systems under denial-of-service attacks such as jamming attacks in wireless channels. One of the discussed challenges is how to achieve ultra-reliable low-latency "signalling" within industrial applications. In~\cite{Cetinkaya_2019}, a discussion is also provided on the recent developments concerning the design of attack-resilient control and communication protocols. Generally, a jamming attacker can block transmission of packets by emitting strong interference signals to a wireless channel \cite{1637931,5473884}. Jamming attacks can target various wireless technologies and hence can become a major concern for control systems, since they are easy to launch \cite{5473884}. It was shown in \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-07788-8_40} that off-the-shelf hardware can be used for generating jamming attacks on wireless networks. In cases of physical-layer attacks, the jamming attacker targets a frequency band and is not required to follow the wireless protocol where it can cause a decrease in the SIR thus preventing the receiver from successfully detecting transmitted packets \cite{10.1007/978-3-319-07788-8_40}. In the case of MAC-layer attacks, both the packet sender and the jamming attacker operate on the same channel; the jamming attackerâ€™s goal is to cause packet collisions.
%In~\cite{8726803}, the authors evaluated the CPSs resilience to jamming attacks that disrupt wireless communications. They considered three jamming strategies which are the constant, random, and protocol-aware jamming. They showed through experimental results that various CPS control schemes are susceptible to constant and random jamming while the time-triggered control schemes are susceptible to protocol-aware jamming. Moreover, resilience of CPSs is also considered in~\cite{6425868,DEPERSIS2014134,7402971,7575630} where periodic jamming is considered in \cite{6425868} while the jamming strategy in~\cite{DEPERSIS2014134,7402971,7575630} is neither known nor pre-fixed. 
% 
%Machine learning has been used for detection and estimation of jamming attacks. In~\cite{Chen2019}, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm based on a multi-layer autoencoder is used to extract the interference source spectrum features. These features are then used to distinguish interference sources type and location without labeling measured data. In~\cite{7911887},  an unsupervised approach using a recurrent neural network to detect anomalies in the CPS performance and identify attacked sensors. In~\cite{Junejo2016DataDP}, a behavior based machine learning intrusion detection approach  is proposed to detect attacks at the physical process layer. The results are validated through experimental study of a real modern water treatment facility. In~\cite{Beaver:2013:EML:2584691.2584722}, the viability of machine learning methods in detecting the new threat scenarios of command and data injection is assessed. In that work, command and control communications in a critical infrastructure setting are monitored and vetted against examples of benign and malicious command traffic to identify potential attack events. In~\cite{6900095}, the authors assessed discriminating types of power system disturbances through machine learning by detecting jamming attacks. They evaluated various machine learning methods as disturbance discriminators and discuss the practical implications for deploying machine learning systems as an enhancement to existing power system architectures.
%
%Therefore, in the literature, it was shown that LQE is one important but insufficient aspect of assessing the impact of link quality on a CPS. We assert that by jointly observing the performance of the physical and wireless components of a CPS,the complete perspective of the quality of the wireless link and its impact on physical performance can be obtained. Since interference is such an important topic in the wireless CPS, we are motivated to propose a method that simultaneously (1) makes observations of the physical system using ground truth measurements, and (2) infers the quality of the wireless communication system in terms of SIR using an experimental model of a relevant use case found in industry.
    
\section{Robot Arm Force-Seeking Application}\label{sec:ftseekerapp}

\subsection{General Construction and Operation}

\begin{figure}[!tbp]

	\caption{Robot force-seeking spring system with controlled wireless channel emulation and interference injection.}
	\label{fig:robotsetup}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.65\columnwidth]{./chapter-ftml/images/PlungerExperiment}
	\caption{A photograph of the robot force-seeking experiment shows the robotic arm, the spring-based plunger, and the visual markers used for position tracking.}
	\label{fig:photo-forceseeker}
\end{figure}	

A robotic force-seeking apparatus is constructed using a Universal Robots UR-3 collaborative robot.  As illustrated in Fig.~\ref{fig:robotsetup}, the robot is fitted with a six degrees-of-freedom (DOF) force-torque sensor (FTS) followed by a probe.  The robot is programmed to apply a downward force, $F(t)$, in the $z$ direction until a force exceeding a threshold, $F_t$, is reported to the controller.  The robot encounters the force threshold through a fixed plunger-spring assembly.  The force in the spring is governed by the equation $F(t)=kl$ where $k$ is the spring constant and $l$ is the spring deflection.  The robot will push the spring downward repeatedly for the duration of 30 minutes.  Plunger movement is limited by a hard stop which will reset the height of the robot arm.  A photograph of the force-seeking apparatus is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:photo-forceseeker}.  The illuminated spheres shown in the photo are infrared markers used by the remote observer to track the position of the probe.

\subsection{Components}

Referring again to Fig.~\ref{fig:robotsetup}, the system is composed of the following components:

\begin{description}
	\item[Robot] The robotic arm applies a downward force along the z-axis to the plunger-spring assembly.  The robot is a 6-DOF rigid body manipulator in which all joints have a full 360 degrees of motion.  For the experiment, the robot is configured such that it would replicate the action of a robot applying a force to push a small part into place within an automotive assembly work-cell~\cite{Cossio2012.RoboticsHandbook}.  The robot is mounted on a motionless optics table in which mechanical vibration is dampened.
	
	\item[Robot Controller] The robot controller (RC) provides the motion control function of all joints on the robot.  The RC is responsible for controlling motion while searching for a force feedback signal.
	
	\item[Force Torque Sensor] The force torque sensor (FTS) provides continuous force and torque readings at a rate of 125 Hz.  Readings from the FTS include force measurements in Newtons along the three Cartesian axes, $x$, $y$, and $z$, and three torque readings in Newton-meters (N-m) about each axis.  The FTS is designed to communicate with the RC through an Ethernet connection. 
	
	\item[Robot End-effector] The robot end-effector (REEF) is a rigid body probe attached to the end of the robot arm just after the FTS.  The REEF is used to make contact with the plunger-spring assembly.   
	
	\item[Wireless Components]  The wireless Ethernet adapter (WEA) replaces the Ethernet connection between the FTS and the RC with a Wi-Fi connection.  The adapter supports the IEEE 802.11 b, g, n, and ac modes. The WEA connects to the RC through a wireless access point (WAP).
	
	\item[Jammer] The jammer provides the source of interference, $J$, which is directly injected into the wireless channel.  For simplicity, interference is injected as non-modulated additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).  The power of $J$ at each receiver is determined by its distance to the jammer.
	
	\item[Channel Emulator] The channel emulator (CE) provides the capability to control the electromagnetic channel between the WEA and the WAP.  The CE supports frequencies between 1 GHz and 6 Ghz and has an instant bandwidth of 250 MHz. It also supports a channel impulse response of 13 taps with a minimum time resolution of 4 ns making the replication of close-quarter multi-path reflections possible.  As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:robotsetup}, all wireless devices are connected to the CE.
	
	\item[Electromagnetic Interference Cabinets] The electromagnetic interference (EMI) cabinets provide isolation between devices such that communication between devices does not occur through radiated leakage.
	
	\item[Wireless Sniffer]  A wireless sniffer (WS) is used to monitor wireless traffic during operation. The sniffer is connected to a laptop computer running Wireshark, and packet logs are used for offline analysis of network events.
	
	\item[Vision Tracking System]  An OptiTrack VS120 Trio is used as the vision-based tracking system (VTS) to produce accurate ground truth measurements of the probe position.  Position estimates along the $z$-axis are captured at the maximum video frame rate of 120 frames per second.  Each estimate includes time and position.
	
\end{description}

\subsection{Robot Arm Motion Control}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.4\columnwidth]{./chapter-ftml/diagrams/reef-model}
	\caption{Feedback signal flow model of the force-seeking controller}
	\label{fig:reefmodel}
\end{figure}

A diagram of the control system for the robotic manipulator is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:reefmodel}.  The UR-3 is constructed of the manipulator assembly and the RC assembly.  The internal construction of the robot arm is irrelevant for this experiment, but it is assumed that the arm produces encoder positions $y(t)$ for each joint.  It is also assumed that the robot arm accepts actuation signals $\vec{u}(t)$ from the motor drives located in the RC.  Both $y(t)$ and $\vec{u}(t)$ are conveyed through wired connections. The force sensor signal $\hat{F}(t)$ is produced by the FTS and is conveyed via an IEEE 802.11 wireless connection. The RC is programmed to move a probe connected to the end of the manipulator downward along a linear path until a force of at least 5 N is detected.  The RC will not move the arm during the force-seeking operation unless it receives an FTS signal; therefore, the duration and continuity of the movement of the arm will be impacted by unreliable communication between the FTS and the RC.

\subsection{RF Emulation Scenario}\label{sec:rfemulator}

\begin{figure}[tbp]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.5\columnwidth]{./chapter-ftml/diagrams/emulation-model}
	\caption{RF emulation scenario design of the robotic force-seeking scenario.}
	\label{fig:rf-emulation-scenario}
\end{figure}

The CE is programmed using a graphical user interface in which the wireless scenario is modeled.  Scenarios are composed of radios, platforms, and links.  Platforms represent the physical machine on which a radio may be deployed.  Platforms may be mobile or stationary, ground-based or aerial. Radios are assigned to platforms, and each radio is associated to a physical port on the emulator.  Links are representations of the physical connections between radios.  Each link has an associated path loss and multi-path representation.  Path loss is implemented according to Friis equation~\cite{Shaw2013.Frii} simplified as 
$P_r = P_t + C - 10\gamma\log_{10}\left( d \right)$, 
where $P_r$ is the received power, $P_t$ is the transmitted power, $C$ is a characteristic constant representing characteristics of the channel and electronics, $\gamma$ is the path loss exponent, and $d$ is the distance between transmitter and receiver.  For simplicity, it is assumed that path loss occurs in accordance with the square of the distance ($\gamma=2$); however, in practice, the path loss exponent is usually greater, causing a more rapid loss of signal power over the same distance~\cite{Candell2017.NIST1951}.  Since the focus of this work is to infer signal quality from ground truth measurements, the path loss exponent is inconsequential to this analysis.

%\begin{equation}
%    P_r = P_t + D_t + D_r + \gamma 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{\lambda}{4 \pi d} \right)
%    \label{eq:frii}
%\end{equation}

Shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:rf-emulation-scenario} is the general scenario for the wireless communication system employed for the force feedback control system.  In the figure, there are three nodes, a wireless router (R), a wireless station (S), and a jammer (J).  The router and station transmit with nominal power that is dependent upon the 802.11 protocol. The jammer transmits with constant power, and its impact on the scenario depends on its position relative to the other nodes.  The distance between J and R is denoted by $d_{J,R}$, and the distance between the J and S is denoted by $d_{J,S}$.  The resulting signal-to-interference power ratio (SIR) for the router is defined in decibels as $SIR_{J,R} = P_{S,R}-P_{J,R}$ which is the power received by the router of the station signal divided by the power of interference experienced at the router.  Similarly, the SIR experienced at the station is defined as $SIR_{J,S} = P_{R,S}-P_{J,S}$ which is the received signal power of the router at the station divided by the interference power experienced at the station.

For each experiment, the location of the J is adjusted to produce a desired SIR.  Each time the location of J is changed, the robot is allowed to operate for a period of 30 minutes.  This included periods of inaction by the robot when the SIR prohibits movement of the arm.  The SIR setting was validated for each run using a real-time spectrum analyzer connected directly to the emulator.
